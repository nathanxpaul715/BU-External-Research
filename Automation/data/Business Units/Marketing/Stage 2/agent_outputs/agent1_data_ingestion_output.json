    "full_bu_intelligence": "EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\nThomson Reuters’ MARKETING function is a strategic growth engine driving customer acquisition, retention, and cross-sell across core segments (Legal, Tax & Accounting, Corporates). Over the past 36 months, Marketing has transformed significantly – evolving from traditional campaigns to data-driven, personalized outreach powered by a modern MarTech ecosystem and AI-enabled workflows. This function now plays a pivotal role in differentiating Thomson Reuters by leveraging the company’s rich domain content (e.g., Westlaw legal data, Checkpoint tax analysis) integrated with advanced marketing technology to deliver tailored customer experiences at scale. Marketing’s strategic importance has only grown as digital engagement becomes the primary mode of customer interaction and revenue generation. \n\nCore Processes & Tools: Marketing’s operations span demand generation, product marketing, digital content, events, and customer insights. Key processes – from campaign planning and lead generation to customer segmentation and performance analytics – have been digitally optimized. The team has implemented a modernized MarTech stack including Salesforce CRM, Oracle Eloqua (marketing automation), Adobe Analytics & Experience Manager, Treasure Data CDP, and collaboration platforms like Seismic and Gong. These systems, along with new Generative AI tools (e.g., an internal Enterprise Writer for content creation, Adobe Firefly/Express for design, Microsoft 365 Copilot for productivity), have streamlined workflows and improved speed-to-market. For example, marketers can now assemble data-driven campaigns much faster – data preparation time has been cut by ~80% through better integration of customer data sources and automation of manual processes. This robust technology and data foundation enables Marketing to execute multi-touch campaigns, track engagement across channels, and iterate quickly based on analytics. \n\nKey Differentiators & Recent Performance: A major differentiator for TR Marketing is its ability to combine trusted proprietary content with cutting-edge marketing techniques. This synergy is yielding tangible results. In the last 18 months, Marketing accelerated its digital engagement strategy – initiatives in SEO, content marketing, and online conversion funnels have increased lead volume and improved conversion quality. As a result, digital sales in the Small Law segment rose to ~59% of segment revenue (exceeding the 49% goal), indicating that more small-firm customers are self-serving through online channels than anticipated. Marketing also embraced AI assistants broadly: internal adoption of marketing AI co-pilot tools reached 93% of the team (versus a 33% target), contributing to faster content creation and data analysis. These efforts led to notable wins such as campaign execution times dropping from weeks to days, and marketing-sourced pipeline growing in targeted segments. Marketing’s data-driven personalization (e.g., tailored messaging by industry and persona) and its use of analytics to refine spend have improved ROI – certain customer cohorts saw double-digit uplift in engagement when campaigns were personalized using insights from the new Customer Data Platform. Importantly, Thomson Reuters’ marketing differentiation is being noticed externally: competitors are beginning to emulate our approach (for example, LexisNexis announced a strategic generative AI alliance with startup Harvey to enhance its legal marketing capabilities in 2025). However, internal assessments have also identified improvement areas that constrain full potential: historically inconsistent customer definitions and siloed data hindered a 360° customer view, data access processes averaged an unwieldy 8–10 weeks, and some analytics models (e.g., propensity scoring) were outdated. These gaps are now being addressed through enterprise-wide data initiatives and AI-driven analytics upgrades, setting the stage for further performance gains. Overall, Marketing’s recent performance underscores its growing impact on revenue and competitive positioning, even as it continues to fine-tune internal processes and data foundations.\n\nAI/GenAI Readiness & Transformation Potential: Marketing has positioned itself at the forefront of AI adoption within the enterprise, piloting numerous generative AI use cases. Over a dozen GenAI tools or pilots have been introduced into marketing workflows (content generation, predictive analytics, campaign optimization), and the function actively co-leads the company’s AI Transformation Program. This high readiness is evidenced by the 93% team adoption rate of AI co-pilots (vastly exceeding the initial goal), and marketing leaders championing AI-driven experiments like the “Marketing AI Persona Assistant” for global teams. The transformation potential remains significant: by further integrating AI into customer journey mapping, lead nurturing, and personalized content, Marketing can achieve even faster go-to-market times and richer customer insights. Additionally, the formation of a new Digital Marketing, Analytics & Technology (DMAT) team in 2024 – consolidating digital activation, marketing ops, and design under one leader – shows a commitment to organizational agility and tech-driven innovation. This positions Marketing to capitalize on emerging technologies (e.g., advanced chatbots for customer engagement, autonomous campaign management agents) with strong governance and alignment. With continued investment in data quality, AI governance, and employee upskilling, Marketing is poised to not only optimize its own operations but also serve as a model for digital transformation across the company.\n\nTop Strategic Recommendations (Next 12–24 months): \n\nUnify Customer Data & Insights – Accelerate ongoing data integration initiatives to eliminate silos and establish a single source of truth for customer information. This will enable true 360° customer views and more effective segmentation, fueling better personalization and higher campaign ROI. Anticipated impact: improved campaign targeting accuracy and higher conversion rates through consistent data, plus faster decision-making due to reliable real-time dashboards. \n\nDeepen AI Integration in Workflows – Expand the use of Generative AI and machine learning across all marketing processes (content creation, A/B testing, lead scoring) while implementing robust governance. Continue pilot programs with clear KPIs, and rapidly scale successful AI use cases (e.g., automate routine copywriting or optimize media spend with AI). Anticipated impact: further 30–50% efficiency gains in content production and analytics, freeing marketers for higher-value strategic work; maintaining Thomson Reuters’ innovation edge as competitors ramp up their AI efforts. \n\nEnhance Cross-Functional Alignment (“Pivot to Pipeline”) – Strengthen collaboration between Marketing, Sales, and Product teams to ensure marketing efforts are tightly linked to pipeline growth and customer success. For instance, refine joint OKRs with Sales (such as shared pipeline contribution targets), and embed marketing analysts in sales feedback loops. Anticipated impact: greater marketing influence on revenue (e.g., higher marketing-originated pipeline percentage), reduced friction in lead hand-offs, and campaigns that better address identified customer needs or sales pain points. \n\nOptimize Marketing Spend & Vendor Portfolio – Conduct a thorough review of marketing spend effectiveness and external vendor contracts. Double down on high-ROI channels (e.g., digital self-serve funnels) and reevaluate lower-performing programs. Leverage analytics to reallocate budget dynamically. Also, rationalize the MarTech and agency portfolio (ensure each tool or partner delivers distinct value, negotiate better terms where possible). Anticipated impact: cost savings of 5–10% that can be reinvested in growth initiatives, an uptick in overall campaign ROI (through focusing on what works best), and a leaner, more nimble vendor ecosystem aligned with Marketing’s strategy. \n\nInvest in Talent & Skills Development – Continue building marketing’s talent base to support digital and AI ambitions. Provide advanced training in data analytics, AI prompt engineering, and agile marketing methods. Hire or develop key new skills in areas like marketing data science and customer experience design. Anticipated impact: a high-performing, future-ready marketing team with the expertise to maximize new technologies; sustained innovation with less reliance on external consultants; and improved retention of top talent by offering growth opportunities in cutting-edge areas.\n\nSTRATEGIC FOUNDATION & BUSINESS ALIGNMENT\nKey Findings for MARKETING:\n\nMarketing’s Role in Enterprise Strategy\nThomson Reuters Marketing is positioned as a strategic growth engine within the enterprise, directly contributing to customer acquisition, retention, and cross-sell across its core segments—Legal, Tax & Accounting, and Corporates.
