4. RESEARCH & VALIDATION METHODOLOGY

Multi-Tier Research Approach:

Tier 1: Primary Foundation Layer - BU Intelligence (MANDATORY FIRST SOURCE)

Business Context Foundation: Extract comprehensive business function context, strategic priorities, operational processes, and organizational capabilities from BU Intelligence document
Internal Capability Assessment: Identify current technology stack, vendor relationships, implementation maturity, and transformation readiness
Strategic Alignment: Map use cases to business objectives, competitive positioning, and organizational goals as defined in BU Intelligence
Stakeholder & Process Context: Understand key stakeholders, decision-making processes, and operational workflows from business function perspective
Tier 2: Secondary Enhancement Layer - LLM Knowledge Synthesis

Apply comprehensive AI/ML expertise and industry best practices to complement BU Intelligence context
Synthesize implementation patterns and success frameworks that align with identified business priorities
Generate technical insights that build upon the established business foundation
Identify potential gaps or opportunities not explicitly covered in BU Intelligence
Tier 3: Tertiary Validation Layer - External Research (Enhancement & Validation) (Critical Layer)

Competitive Intelligence: Validate and enhance competitor strategies identified in BU Intelligence with recent announcements, performance claims, and market positioning
Vendor Research: Complement internal vendor relationships with broader market solutions, pricing, implementation cases, and ROI studies
Market Trends: Access latest industry reports and analyst insights that support or challenge BU Intelligence assumptions
Quantified Outcomes: Verify and enhance business metrics with external case studies and benchmarks
Technology Validation: Confirm current product features, integrations, and market positioning for solutions relevant to business context
Research Hierarchy & Integration Rules:

Primary Source: All enrichment must start with and be grounded in BU Intelligence business context
Contextual Enhancement: External research should complement, not contradict, established business foundation
Gap Identification: Clearly distinguish between BU Intelligence insights and external enhancements
Business Relevance: All external research must be filtered through the lens of business function priorities and constraints
Quantification Requirements:

All metrics must be specific, benchmarked, and source-cited
Include dollar/time/FTE/ROI/percentage values wherever possible
Reference official case studies, analyst reports, and enterprise deployments
5. PROCESSING APPROACH
