This limits our ability to scale coverage and slows time-to-market for critical financial insights. While our editorial teams maintain high standards for both relevance and accuracy, the volume and velocity of market-moving information increasingly demand faster, more scalable solutions. We are developing AI-assisted tools to extract concise, accurate fact snippets that meet Reuters standards while significantly reducing the time and effort required from journalists.

"Summarization","Reuters - Editorial","10/3/2025","Green – as per plan or better","Launch","LEON,Open Arena","Build","1,000","Reuters journalists currently spend significant time drafting stories from press releases and manually reworking published content into alternate formats such as video scripts, newsletter blurbs, or social media posts. These tasks, while essential, are time-intensive and limit our ability to scale coverage or experiment with new formats. Our editorial standards under the Trust Principles require accuracy, clarity, and context—standards that off-the-shelf summarization tools cannot yet meet without human oversight.
We are developing AI-assisted summarization tools that can generate high-quality first drafts of stories—such as our new “Super Summaries” for earnings coverage—and reformat existing Reuters stories into alternate formats with minimal manual intervention. These tools are designed to accelerate the drafting process while preserving editorial rigor, enabling journalists to focus on value-added reporting and analysis. They also support our Professional strategy by making Reuters content more modular, discoverable, and adaptable to client needs across platforms like LSEG Workspace, newsletters, and video feeds.
This hybrid model—where automation handles the initial synthesis and journalists provide oversight—will allow us to increase output, reduce latency, and expand into new formats and languages. It also lays the groundwork for future monetization of structured content and supports our broader newsroom transformation toward AI-augmented workflows.

The goal is to reduce the time required to produce a complete shot list and story package, freeing up producers to focus on higher-value creative work.

This model provides an unsteady inflow of content, and also presents several critical limitations that impact our ability to stay ahead in a rapidly evolving legal landscape.
The core challenge is transitioning from a passive, submission-based model to a proactive, data-driven approach that empowers us to:
• Identify trending and emerging legal topics in real time
• Proactively seek out potential authors and thought leaders
• Quickly fill gaps in our catalog and respond to market demand

•Editorial teams in coordination with print marketing proactively identify and engage leading and emerging subject matter experts.
•Content gaps are minimized, ensuring comprehensive coverage across legal fields.
•Our offerings consistently anticipate market demands, rather than reacting to them.
•We quickly publish new titles on topics gaining momentum in the legal community.
•Our brand reputation strengthens as a forward-thinking, authoritative source for legal information.
