In Q3 we continue to test and begin adoption of the GenAI tools that will drive the most value into 2024 and beyond. With a headcount of 1,263 across Sales, Customer Success, Professional Services, and their support teams, we are leveraging tools such as Open Arena, CoPilot on Bing, Microsoft Copilot, Conversica, Gainsight, Salesforce (Einstein + Revenue Intelligence), and Gong. These tools are aimed at enhancing productivity, operational efficiencies, internal collaboration, and external customer satisfaction, ultimately driving increased Net Revenue Retention.  ​

Full operational and financial impacts are still to be confirmed, early adoption suggests promising improvements. ​","Additional resourcing is needed to deliver on this extensive adoption plan including resources to deliver on initiatives and development of internal use cases specifically within Professional Services  ​

It was necessary additional alignments within the provider to understand what capabilities we should expect to test since not all the functionalities will be available since we are not going to connect Gong with the local CRMs we have in the Region. ​

The decision was made to move forward with the pilot without having additional projects being required and test only the functionalities that are available in this model.","During the first discussions of the pilot, we’ve identified that Gong cannot connect the same instance of the tool with difference SFDC instances. Since Latam users are on S2E SFDC instance or SGD as their CRMs, we needed to understand the capabilities / options to be considered under the pilot scope before moving forward. ​

We explored the different options for your Gong implementation, including setting up a new instance, using the existing GSI Salesforce instance, or waiting for another time. ​

We reviewed a comparison matrix of Gong features that would be available under each option, highlighting the limitations of the existing GSI instance in terms of account-based functionality. ​

​The activities in November have primarily focused on the implementation and official launch of the Gong trial. ​

​

The pilot participants have access to the Gong platform and have been directed to the Gong Academy, a self-led training tool that helps end users utilize Gong effectively. Live training for Legal took place on November 6th. Gong SteerCo has finalized feedback metrics and method.  As part of Internal Change Management, Legal will utilize the Gong feedback loop as a prototype to gather feedback, benefits, and assessments for all future tech evaluations, which can then be applied to other tech evaluations and segments. Thus far, preliminary feedback reflects that Gong looks good for front leader productivity (reducing time spent on forecasting (~2 hrs per week) and that it provides greater forecasting accuracy. Also time savings around tasks such as meeting prep, meeting summarization is reducing tasks down to about 5 minutes as opposed to 15 to 20. We expect to see more and better data as the trial continues, and more feedback comes in.​

Need strong change management cadence to drive adoption. Teams are adapting to a significant amount of change currently with new products, new vision for TR GAI, new selling skill (from product selling to value/ROI-based selling) and new CS model. Risk of introducing too much change at one time – mitigate with showing value to the rep/team member on how our internal adoption will support their new workflow and will streamline their efforts to drive efficiencies. The Gong change management strategy revolves around a 'leaders first' approach, cultivating a culture of innovation and adaptability and focus on developing powerful internal champions who drive transformation from within. by leveraging targeted use cases, for a clear and digestible way to apply Gong to their day to day workflow. ​

","As we move some of our internal projects towards commercialisation, we need some different roles and structures. This is beyond the scope of the Internal AI Program but will be a large part of our shift in focus for 2025. There have been some delays on one of our client-focused projects due to ownership and planning processes which have shown us the need to start thinking differently in a fast test-and-iterate world.
eyond Newsroom, many of our commercial teams now need more help to integrate AI into their workflows and are finding limitations with the UI of Open Arena and limitations on which data we can use safely e.g. financial/HR/client data. We need to unlock some of these issues with the AI Platform and Responsible AI groups to understand where the limits are and how we can work within them.

There is concern on the video desk that the new shotlisting tool may, in fact, add work without significant tuning so we may have to do more testing and iteration before rolling it out. This is a much anticipated time saver so we need to get it right for our colleagues as well as for our clients.

GitHubCoPilot code suggestion acceptance rate among licensed users is steady over the last two months at 30%.  Presented the GitHub Copilot adoption update at the Product Engineering LT meeting on November 19th. The presentation covered progress so far and our upcoming plans, and it was well received.   A framework has been established for tool adoption, and efforts are underway to evaluate and select the most suitable tools. We begin the rollout plan for Amazon Q Dev, as well as discussion on 2025 OKR for AI Assisted Developer Tools.  Overall, the project is progressing well, with a focus on effective cost management and user experience.","•	Surveys:   The Pull Request (PR) driven survey responses are steady at 20%.  Have already communicated to Engineering Pilot participants to help drive higher participation.  Need to further socialize with Champions and PE LT for tops down push to help drive greater response rates and implement possible mandatory training. 
•	Data Accuracy:   GitHub's seat and usage telemetry APIs are stable over last four months.  
•	Tool Evaluation: Continued evaluation of the impact and value of various tools, including GitHub Copilot, to ensure they are continuing to add value to the organization and business.
","Adoption:  GitHub CoPilot licenses increased by 150  and we now have 3183  licensed users  across Thomson Reuters.  We added executive summary to the dashboard Github Copilot dashboard  and license activations continue to be tracked, continuing in monitor and maintain mode.  
Usage & Engagement: Upon request, Github recently shared a benchmarking report of Copilot usage based on their internal datasets.  The report does show TR usage trending above industry averages by 10+ percentage points across all three of % active user, % engaged user and %  installed/authenticated user.  In particular, Github’s report shows TR’s weekly engaged rates remaining steady at around.  
Measuring Impact: Based on the pull request analysis, results show increased productivity post-Copilot, with a 20-30% increase in the average number of PRs created and merged. About 80% of the champions took the survey and provided positive feedback on its use, noting notable challenges and limitations with lengthy code generation, legacy scripts, etc., which are known and documented. 

AWS Q Developer:   While GitHub Copilot remains the superior overall tool, AWS Q Developer is particularly effective for working with AWS technologies and has shown significant improvement. We are beginning to roll out AWS Q across the organization, following a similar approach to GitHub Copilot adoption. This will allow for a comprehensive comparison of AI Pair Programming tools and leverage existing metrics dashboards.

Our key objectives are to maximize the potential of our existing tools, particularly Salesforce and Gainsight, and identify areas where additional solutions can further support our goals.

Current Progress and Initiatives:
We are optimizing the use of tools like MS Copilot, with expanded access across the organization, to enhance productivity and efficiency.
Our Professional Services team is actively working on two projects aimed at driving productivity gains, with an additional nine projects in the scoping phase for future development.

Pilot Program Update:
A pilot of Gong was conducted in Q4-2024, with 20 out of 40 participants actively engaging. Although feedback was positive, we have decided not to proceed with a full rollout due to funding and resource constraints.

Future Direction:
Our strategy for 2025 is to continue to fully utilize our current tools and assess potential gaps that may be addressed through additional solutions.
We will prioritize initiatives that drive tangible productivity gains, operational efficiencies, and customer satisfaction improvements, ultimately supporting our Net Revenue Retention goals.

By building on our existing foundation and strategically investing in AI-powered tools and initiatives, we are well-positioned to drive business growth, improve customer satisfaction, and maintain our competitive edge in the market.","The successful execution of our Corporate Internal Gen AI strategy is contingent upon addressing several key risks and issues. The following areas require attention to ensure the effective implementation and adoption of our AI-powered tools:

Resourcing Constraints: The strategy's success is dependent on securing additional resourcing to drive the development and deployment of AI-powered solutions. Insufficient resourcing may hinder our ability to fully leverage the potential of our existing tools, such as Gainsight, Salesforce, and Conversica, and may limit our capacity to explore new solutions.

Centralized Team Support: It was already called out and acknowledged in a February 4 meeting that more support is needed from centralized teams and product owners. To ensure end-users are aware of and proficient in using the Gen AI functionality, we require more active engagement and enablement from these teams. This includes providing training, documentation, and change management support to facilitate seamless adoption and optimal utilization of our AI-powered tools.

End-User Adoption and Enablement: The effective use of Gainsight, Salesforce, and Conversica, in particular, relies on end-users being aware of the Gen AI functionality and understanding how to leverage it to drive productivity gains and customer satisfaction improvements. Without sufficient support and enablement, we risk underutilization of these critical tools, which may negatively impact our ability to achieve our Net Revenue Retention goals.

To mitigate these risks, it is essential that we prioritize securing additional resourcing, foster stronger collaboration with centralized teams and product owners, and develop a comprehensive enablement strategy to support end-user adoption and proficiency with our AI-powered tools. By addressing these key risks and issues, we can ensure the successful execution of our Corporate Internal Gen AI strategy and realize the full potential of our AI-powered tools to drive business growth and customer satisfaction.","Professional Services Team Initiatives: The Professional Services team has made significant headway on two high-priority use cases, which are currently in development. Additionally, nine further use cases are being refined and will be presented to the Analytics team for support in scoping and implementing. This collaboration will enable us to leverage data-driven insights to inform our AI-powered solutions and drive business outcomes.

MS Copilot Expansion: We have successfully secured an additional 105 MS Copilot licenses, effective January 1, 2025. This expansion will enable more employees to leverage the productivity-enhancing capabilities of MS Copilot, driving efficiency gains and supporting our goal of improving Net Revenue Retention through enhanced customer satisfaction and reduced churn.","Training and Enablement:
Introduction to Open Arena training was provided on 6/12/2024

Copilot for 365 training was held 9/12/2024

Communication and Awareness:
The Corporates Eye on AI Launch included the creation of a Teams channel on 8/15/2024 and a champions network on 8/20/2024.
A newsletter was initially planned but was put on pause due to competing Future of Corporates (FoC) priorities.

Feedback and Pulse Checks:
The September OHI survey included a question on AI adoption, with 76% of participants responding that they agree the organization helps them understand and use AI in their daily work.

End-of-Year Update:
Communications were paused in light of Future of Corporates priorities. ","As we look to 2025, our path forward is focused on building on the foundation established in 2024, with a emphasis on optimizing the adoption of our current tools, expanding the use of AI-powered solutions, and driving business outcomes through targeted use cases. Key priorities include:

Optimizing Current Tools: We will focus on maximizing the potential of our existing tools, particularly Gainsight and Salesforce, to drive productivity gains, operational efficiencies, and customer satisfaction improvements.

Restarting and Expanding Conversica: We will restart and expand our use of Conversica, leveraging its capabilities to enhance our sales and customer engagement efforts.

Accelerating Professional Services Use Cases: We will prioritize the development of Professional Services use cases, focusing on internal process improvement initiatives that drive tangible business outcomes. The recent Professional Services focus group meeting on November 20 marked an important step in this effort, and we will continue to build on this momentum.

There is a risk that we remain too focused on solving past problems rather than give due weight to the opportunities that lie ahead. We are considering carving out a percentage of time for key team members to do more AI research e.g. on small language models built in similar ways to Deep Seek. Another risk is that solutions we created in the past, particularly Avista, might no longer be fit for purpose as models have moved on so quickly. We need to be nimble (think fast, act fast!) and persuade teams it is fine to pivot but without making them dizzy.

We are also living up to the promise that people whose jobs might be impacted by AI will likely see their roles expand (Spanish and Portuguese video launch and new roles on Project LUX). We had excellent engagement on AI at the ASM and are working with Ethelda Makoid to get some more sales training across from TR into Reuters and expect this will help people on their own journey in gen AI.

LEON - we are moving beyond summarisation and headlines to include our first editing tools, live transcription and French translation editing in the next months. More broadly we are running a POC to see how gen AI can help us draft stories. 
AVISTA - we may need a rethink of our video workflow tools given issues with latency in the current solution. We will link this work to the new customer-focused Agency AI stream as many of the issues we have in video production are similar for our clients. It's a good opportunity to stop and rethink.

It was necessary additional alignments within the provider to understand what capabilities we should expect to test since not all the functionalities will be available since we are not going to connect Gong with the local CRMs we have in the Region. 
The decision was made to move forward with the pilot without having additional projects being required and test only the functionalities that are available in this model.
","During the first discussions of the pilot, we’ve identified that Gong cannot connect the same instance of the tool with difference SFDC instances. Since Latam users are on S2E SFDC instance or SGD as their CRMs, we needed to understand the capabilities / options to be considered under the pilot scope before moving forward. 
We explored the different options for your Gong implementation, including setting up a new instance, using the existing GSI Salesforce instance, or waiting for another time. 
We reviewed a comparison matrix of Gong features that would be available under each option, highlighting the limitations of the existing GSI instance in terms of account-based functionality. 
We will need to have a local person trained by the Gong team due to language limitation, with that our launch will be postponed, since there is the need of a new SOW for the train the trainer program.

Our key objectives are to maximize the potential of our existing tools, particularly Salesforce and Gainsight, and identify areas where additional solutions can further support our goals.

Current Progress and Initiatives:
We are optimizing the use of tools like MS Copilot, with expanded access across the organization, to enhance productivity and efficiency.
Our Professional Services team is actively working on two projects aimed at driving productivity gains, with an additional nine projects in the scoping phase for future development.

Gong: A pilot of Gong was conducted in Q4-2024, with 20 out of 40 participants actively engaging. As of February 27, 2025, Corporates is moving forward with 633 Gong licenses. Erin Brown provided an update on Monday, February 24. CE is currently working with sourcing to purchase the licenses and are connecting with Sara Donavan of the Corporates Transformation Team on Friday, February 28, 2025 to discuss the rollout plan. 

Future Direction:
Our strategy for 2025 is to continue to fully utilize our current tools and assess potential gaps that may be addressed through additional solutions.
We will prioritize initiatives that drive tangible productivity gains, operational efficiencies, and customer satisfaction improvements, ultimately supporting our Net Revenue Retention goals.

By building on our existing foundation and strategically investing in AI-powered tools and initiatives, we are well-positioned to drive business growth, improve customer satisfaction, and maintain our competitive edge in the market.
","The successful execution of our Corporate Internal Gen AI strategy is contingent upon centralized team support and end-user adoption enablement. 

Centralized Team Support: It was already called out and acknowledged in a February 4 meeting that more support is needed from centralized teams and product owners to drive AI adoption within the tools they support. To ensure end-users are aware of and proficient in using the Gen AI functionality, we require more active engagement and enablement from these teams. This includes supporting the roll out, providing training, documentation, and change management support to facilitate seamless adoption and optimal utilization of our AI-powered tools.

End-User Adoption and Enablement: The effective use of Gainsight, Salesforce, and Conversica, in particular, relies on end-users being aware of the Gen AI functionality and understanding how to leverage it to drive productivity gains and customer satisfaction improvements. Without sufficient training, support and enablement, we risk underutilization of these critical tools, which may negatively impact our ability to achieve our Net Revenue Retention goals.

Change Management: There is no designated change management support in 2025. As we roll out new AI tools in 2025, it is imperative that change management is prioritized by every group rolling out a solution. They need to acknowledge the current organizational landscape and present the tools as solutions to existing challenges. By doing so, we can ensure a smoother adoption, maximize the benefits of these innovative technologies, and effectively address the needs of our stakeholders.

To drive successful adoption of new tools, we must clearly define ownership, collaborate with Sales Enablement on training and support, and embed a change management mindset across teams to address current challenges and demonstrate the problem-solving value of these tools.","As of 2/27/2025, an additional 105 MS Copilot licenses have been assigned to Corporates users bringing the total Copilot licenses assigned to 705.

CE is currently working with sourcing to purchase the licenses and are connecting with Sara Donavan of the Corporates Transformation Team on Friday, February 28, 2025 to discuss the rollout plan. ","There has not been any new change management efforts since the start of 2025. The need has been raised above and will be the responsibility of all to consider the current state and how the solutions help address the current challenges. 

","As we look to 2025, our path forward is focused on building on the foundation established in 2024, with a emphasis on optimizing the adoption of our current tools, expanding the use of AI-powered solutions, and driving business outcomes through targeted use cases. Key priorities include:

Optimizing Current Tools: We will focus on maximizing the potential of our existing tools, particularly Gainsight, enabling Einstein tools in Salesforce (particularly Revenue Intelligence to launch in late Q1), and Copilot to drive productivity gains, operational efficiencies, and customer satisfaction improvements.

Restarting and Expanding Conversica: We will restart and expand our use of Conversica, leveraging its capabilities to enhance our sales and customer engagement efforts and explore expansion across other teams in Corporates. 

Accelerating Professional Services Use Cases: We will prioritize the development of Professional Services use cases, focusing on internal process improvement initiatives that drive tangible business outcomes.

We are seeing great collaboration between all of our engineering partners - AI Platform, Content Platform, Content Workflow, Labs - particularly as we work on some challenging issues related to handling large documents, doing rapid AI experimentation, and facilitating rapid deployment.","We only have one UX designer, which may be problematic as we seek to move fast to build the capabilities, while also creating an effective and efficient user experience.

We are keeping an eye on LLM costs, which raise questions about the ROI. Right now, we are confident that costs will continue to decrease and our efficiency will continue to improve.

Deployment is contingent on successful testing - and testing requires time and people. It is challenging to manage the desired amount of testing when we are dealing with wide variation across content types, jurisdictions, and publications. We have willing vendor resources, but limited budget - and right now we are trying to handle as much of the testing in-house as possible.","Invisible: use case closed as team has decided not to continue the POC. Tool has good annotation features, but there are no DIY workflow or task build capabilities and there is no expectation that they would be available anytime soon. Integrating Invisible with Content Console was proving more challenging than simply building the capabilities we need.

Judicial Filings: team is cautiously optimistic that the MVP Briefs workflow will be code-complete by end of March and tested in April - but as it is the first end-to-end workflow being built with the DIY features and integrating LLMs into the content processing workflows, new challenges continue to arise.

Primary Law: AI Assistant for short title styling of US judicial decisions in JWB is on track, though there is some concern that it might not be possible to extend this solution to other use cases. UK Caselaw normalization is proceeding as expected, with some challenges related to large documents and the need to 'chunk' them for processing. Experimentation is underway for many additional use cases.

Employee AI tool adoption is increasing, targeting 50% regular usage by 2025, supported by strategic communication and innovation initiatives.","1.	RISK - The rollout of Salesforce Einstein has slowed due to problems with publishing from AEM Guides to Salesforce and content creation capacity constraints.  An Adobe hotfix will deployed in February 202 (2/10/25) and content will push to Salesforce soon after. This delay adds risk to the planned 2025 efficiencies.
a.	Mitigation Strategy: Agents have undergone training to author help and support content and generative AI available through Adobe are being explored to address capacity constraints. 
2.	RISK - Efficiencies estimates: Multiple risks to the accuracy of the 2025 productivity estimates including overlap - where anticipated productivity gains from multiple AI initiatives may overlap, delivery timing, incorrect assumptions, etc.  impacting our overall savings estimates. ","•The Intelligent Assistant has been deployed to all Accounting CS, Practice CS, and UltraTax CS agents, with training sessions conducted in November and December. The overall engagement rate is approximately 20%, with 73 agents using the tool on 10% or more of their handled calls or chats. The effort notably reduced Average Handling Time (AHT) 7.7% y/y in January.
The tool has shown effectiveness in enhancing support capabilities. The team is focused on refining and optimizing its features based on user feedback and increasing adoption. Recent enhancements include making the Intelligent Assistant available in the UltraTax CS picklist of resources via the Agent Extension for Chrome and Edge. Upcoming enhancements include the addition of internal articles by the end of March. Roll out is planned for 36 additional agents supporting Cloud Audit Suite in June..  
•Further roll-out of Salesforce Einstein GPT and AI knowledge workflow features is on hold due to challenges syncing help content, creating new support content and categorizing content so results returned to agents are relevant. An Adobe hotfix addressing the synch issue was received on February 10, 2025. The AEM to Salesforce connection hotfix is complete, with ongoing stability testing. Content is being pushed from AEM to Salesforce and monitored. Efforts are underway to clean up article duplication from the hotfix, apply content categorization tagging, and improve the knowledge search function before roll-outs to further groups.
• In January, the call deflection for the WhatsApp-based AI self-service tool was 33.3%, an increase of 7pts Month over month, and 53% of requests were solved without human interaction. Early abandoned contact was 16%, a decrease of 2pp month over month showing a positive trend in customer engagement. The in-product Product Support Assistant in TaxOne and LegalOne has been well received, with  9% of customers who opened cases in Jan accessing the AI tool.
•The  Help and Support content team has paused at the proof of concept stage for a home-grown Gen AI solution while analyzing AI tools becoming available through Adobe's cloud solution at mid-year.  These tools are included as part of our current agreement with Adobe.  Initial analysis suggests that the Adobe functionality will be sufficient and provide AI tools to speed authoring and publishing.  Final decision will be made by early March.   
•We are preparing for the Genesys Salesforce Voice deployment by aligning key dates, coordinating trainings, and finalizing KPIs. This initiative will integrate telephony into Salesforce, enhancing agent productivity with AI-powered insights. We aim to deploy the new feature to 225 customer service agents and reference attorneys in Q1, ensuring minimal impact through thorough training and stakeholder coordination.
•Two high- impact initiatives are underway in C2C.  The UI/Suspense Payment Application Initiative aims to automate the manual process of identifying customers using AI and bots. Currently in the ""Test and Learn"" phase, this initiative is expected to reduce UI/Suspense cases by 50%, improve accuracy, and decrease human error. This will enhance customer experience through faster processing and higher satisfaction. The model's scalability allows it to handle high transaction volumes and seasonal fluctuations, with plans to expand from 2 regions to all regions. The C2C Customer Queries Initiative aims to analyze and predict customer inquiries using LLM. The project, in the """"Test and Learn"""" phase, utilizes the AI CARF model to improve customer support, handling around 20,000 queries monthly. This reduces resolution time from 5 days to 2 in 75% of cases and provides insights into customer behavior. It helps identify root issues, lowering dissatisfaction and churn rates for recurring queries. Overall, it enhances support, shortens resolution times, and delivers actionable insights to improve customer experience.","An initial pathway to  2025 savings target has been identified and confirmed with leadership.  Through January, CXD is on track to achieve FY savings plan of $1.6M with some favorability.  FY projected favorability of $270K is due to higher amount of attrition with no backfill.  Forecast was to not backfill 1 FTE in Jan, actual reduction was 11.  As we refresh our numbers for the March forecast, we will likely reduce the reductions in future months as they have already been achieved in January.  This will result in slightly less FY favorability. 

CXD has adopted the TR Enterprise AI OKR for 2025 and will ensure 50% of CXD employees are using Gen AI tools regularly as part of their daily task.  In January 37.7% of CXD employees used Ai tools regularly + 6pp increase from December.  We expect this number to rise naturally as we deploy additional AI tools across the year.
In support of the 2025 goal and to address feedback from 2024 the AI Skills and Adoption survey CXD AI lead and HRBP are working through a department AI communications plan including AI Champions and persona-based AI learning recommendations for 2025.  CXD AI Atrium page and first monthly newsletter (AI Spark: AI Innovation in CXD) will deploy in March.

A working group has been identified and the team will also begin an initiative to leveraging the AIvolution tool (Ideaspace Hub) as a way to capture and govern AI innovation ideas in March.

Demand for MSFT  365 Copilot licenses remains high as groups find Copilot has proven to be an invaluable tool in our daily operations.  Approximate number of licenses held by CXD expanded from ~180 to ~200 in February. Expansion of license availability is largely targeted at product/project managers and team leads/people managers.","Continued Development and Deployment of planned AI Initiatives:

Other initiatives include the transition to Adobe's cloud solution, automation of payment applications, and the use of AI to predict customer queries. The March report also addresses key risks and issues impacting AI knowledge tools and outlines mitigation strategies. Finally, the path forward includes continued development and deployment of planned AI initiatives, communication and governance efforts, and acceleration opportunities to enhance AI integration across the organization.
","Effectiveness of our AI knowledge tools is being impacted by several issues.
Issue:  Help and Support content was written for web presentation to customers and is not categorized in a way that Salesforce understands, leading to inefficiencies in search and in some cases resulting in incorrect articles being returned by Einstein
Mitigation: Implement a robust categorization system that aligns with Salesforce's requirements. Enhance search functionalities by making filters sticky and improving the initial global search results. Regularly review and update the categorization to ensure it remains effective

Issue:  Intelligent Assistant and Salesforce Einstein are exclusively limited to knowledge articles and do not utilize other data sources in their AI grounding.  This restricts the range of accessible information as 1) migration of knowledge articles to AEM Guides is not yet complete, resulting in gaps within the knowledge base and 2) doesn’t leverage other possible sources like Salesforce and Flash cases and Flash cases
Mitigation: Complete the migration process by reviewing, categorizing, and publishing all articles in AEM Guides.

Usage has been around 20% from December to February. In February, it reduced average handle time (AHT) by 14%, despite a 15% increase in call volume. Improved training modules and integrated support content have boosted performance. Efforts continue to expand usage and enhance capabilities.  Plans include training new agents post-spring peak, adding new content for content the Web Services and Fixed Asset products and internal content in April, and introducing language localization. Additional for Roll out is planned for 36 additional agents supporting Cloud Audit Suite in June. 
•	The AEM to Salesforce connection hotfix is complete and signed off. Content is being pushed from AEM to Salesforce and monitored. Efforts continue to clean up article duplication, apply content categorization tagging, and improve knowledge search before further roll-outs. Teams are preparing for the rollout of Salesforce Einstein GPT and AI knowledge for Legal CTS and CS Canada agents ahead of the fall peak. The focus is on building a robust knowledge base, aiming for full content population by July 1 to allow time for rollout and training before peak season.
•	The Service Cloud Voice deployment for Reference Attorneys and Customer Service has been slightly delayed to April 25th due to dependencies on fixes by Genesys and Salesforce Development teams and to allow sufficient time for agent training and change management. Teams continue to process on related development including Einstein Next Best Action, targeted for the same April release.  The Q2 Service Cloud Voice deployment for Product Support teams remains on track, and a kick-off with Product Support leadership will occur in the next few weeks.
•	In February, the call deflection for the WhatsApp-based AI self-service tool for the LatAm region was 33%, remaining steady month over month, with 50% of requests resolved without human interaction. Early abandoned contact was 16%, a decrease of 1 percentage point month over month, indicating a positive trend in customer engagement. The usage of the Product Support Assistant embedded within the product increased by 85% month over month for TaxOne and 833% for LegalOne. Customer engagement is indicated by 32% of distinct users opening cases.
•	The WhatsApp India Project aims to provide extended support for India-based Global 7 and other Extended support subscribers in India for ONESOURCE Income Tax and GoSystem beyond U.S. hours. Customer support volumes have increased by approximately 33% for calls (23%) and chats (61%) for ONESOURCE Income Tax and GoSystem customers, with 70% of customers using mobile devices. The WhatsApp India Project intends to deflect 10% of current call volumes and improve customer satisfaction through reduced wait times by implementing AI-driven WhatsApp support as an additional touch point for customers, leveraging the platform's widespread popularity in India. The target date for going live is May 5, 2025.
•	The Help and Support content team is working to plan and schedule the transition to Adobe's cloud solution (AEM Cloud). This multi-tenant transition must be managed to ensure smooth migration. The team is evaluating an AI solution to identify relevant knowledge base articles for updates and the AI tools that Adobe will provide after migration. These tools are part of our agreement with Adobe. Initial analysis indicates that Adobe's functionality will suffice and offer AI tools for faster authoring and publishing.   
•	Two high- impact initiatives are underway in C2C.  The UI/Suspense Payment Application initiative is designed to automate the matching of payments to customer accounts through the utilization of AI and bots. Previously a manual process, it now employs AI and bots to identify accounts with unapplied and suspense payments, after which the Cash Applications team reallocates the balance to the appropriate customer account. This process is currently overseen by the Automation Center of Excellence team to ensure stability, with plans for the business to trigger the automation as needed in the future. The application has been deployed in the US Legal and LatAm regions, while development and testing are ongoing for the ANZ, UK, and Ireland regions, with an expected deployment in Q2. This initiative aims to reduce UI/Suspense cases by 50% by improving speed, accuracy, and reducing human error.  The C2C Customer Queries initiative focuses on analyzing and predicting customer inquiries using LLM. Currently in the ""Test and Learn"" phase, the project employs the AI CARF model to enhance C2C customer support, managing approximately 20,000 queries monthly. This tool assists in identifying root issues and providing insights into customer behavior. It is expected to reduce resolution time from 5 days to 2 in 75% of cases, thereby decreasing dissatisfaction and churn rates for recurring queries. Future steps will involve developing workflows and resolving stability issues on the new platform.
","CXD has adopted the TR Enterprise AI OKR for 2025 and will ensure 50% of CXD employees are using Gen AI tools regularly as part of their daily task.  In February 40.6% of CXD employees used Ai tools regularly (+ 2.8 pp m/m increase).  We expect this number to continue to rise naturally as we deploy additional AI tools across our CSS agent population the year and use our AI communication channels to promote AI learning opportunities and innovative ways our colleagues are using AI in their day to day work.

To support the 2025 TR AI goal and address feedback from 2024, the CXD AI lead and HRBP are developing a department AI communications plan. This includes AI Champions and persona-based AI learning recommendations for 2025. The CXD AI Atrium page and the first monthly newsletter (AI Spark: AI Innovation in CXD) will be launched in mid-April and will be supported by an intake process for success stories across the group. The group has also adopted an AI co-worker avatar to include in communications about AI tools to support agents. This avatar communicates that the intent of the AI deployments is to support agents.

A working group has been formed to deploy the Idea Space tool as a way to capture and govern AI ideas across CSD.  The team held a kick-off and are in the process of documenting configuration and governance requirements. It is expected the tool will roll out across CXD in April.

Demand for MSFT  365 Copilot licenses remains high as groups find Copilot has proven to be an invaluable tool in streamlining our daily operations.  The approximate number of licenses held by CXD will be expanded to ~220 in Q2.

Our key objectives are to maximize the potential of our existing tools, particularly Salesforce and Gainsight, and identify areas where additional solutions can further support our goals.

Current Progress and Initiatives:
We are optimizing the use of tools like MS Copilot, with expanded access across the organization, to enhance productivity and efficiency.
Our Professional Services team is actively working on two projects aimed at driving productivity gains, with an additional nine projects in the scoping phase for future development.

Gong: A pilot of Gong was conducted in Q4-2024, with 20 out of 40 participants actively engaging. As of February 27, 2025, Corporates is moving forward with 633 Gong licenses. Erin Brown provided an update on Monday, February 24. CE is currently working with sourcing to purchase the licenses and are connecting with Sara Donavan of the Corporates Transformation Team on Friday, February 28, 2025 to discuss the rollout plan. 

Future Direction:
Our strategy for 2025 is to continue to fully utilize our current tools and assess potential gaps that may be addressed through additional solutions.
We will prioritize initiatives that drive tangible productivity gains, operational efficiencies, and customer satisfaction improvements, ultimately supporting our Net Revenue Retention goals.

By building on our existing foundation and strategically investing in AI-powered tools and initiatives, we are well-positioned to drive business growth, improve customer satisfaction, and maintain our competitive edge in the market.
","The successful execution of our Corporate Internal Gen AI strategy is contingent upon centralized team support and end-user adoption enablement. 

Centralized Team Support: It was already called out and acknowledged in a February 4 meeting that more support is needed from centralized teams and product owners to drive AI adoption within the tools they support. To ensure end-users are aware of and proficient in using the Gen AI functionality, we require more active engagement and enablement from these teams. This includes supporting the roll out, providing training, documentation, and change management support to facilitate seamless adoption and optimal utilization of our AI-powered tools.

End-User Adoption and Enablement: The effective use of Gainsight, Salesforce, and Conversica, in particular, relies on end-users being aware of the Gen AI functionality and understanding how to leverage it to drive productivity gains and customer satisfaction improvements. Without sufficient training, support and enablement, we risk underutilization of these critical tools, which may negatively impact our ability to achieve our Net Revenue Retention goals.

This solution is for whitespace discovery calls. v2 is in development in partnership with Commercial Excellence and will introduce existing customer data to the solution. Planned pilot shifted from Q1 to early Q2 as we learn how specific guidance to the various agents must be to be effective.

Copilot licenses have been extended to sales managers, bringing total deployment up to ~120 users. TAAP continues to see high utilization of Copilot where deployed.

Gong continues to get positive praise from the sales team, with call recording completion of Teams meetings sitting at 54%. This completion rate has remained fairly consistent throughout 2024. We are finding varied usage patterns of the functions within Gong. Some users favor Follow-up Email and Ask Anything, while others see the most benefit from using the Pipeline Intelligence area. And while average weekly logins remains steady at 2 logins per week, we want to drive DAILY use of Gong, even if only for a few features. All US-based SEs, CEs, and SDRs now have Gong access.

","The changes in underlying models can be great but can also deprecate performance or take a lot of time to test. This has been true of the new release of DeepL which was too clever for its own good. Also there are advantages to Sonnet but if the latency is worse, we can't take the risk as speed is so important to us. Our engineering teams are working this through.","FactGenie - Completed integration of all ""content"" feeds, including the final ones which needed more PDF cracking and have started on the releases which contain a URL so that the content on the link is surfaced in FactGenie. Expanded our testing of Sonnet vs GPT 4 but it seems that it is slower so we may roll back on that as speed is of the essence. May also look at whether we can expand limit rates on Sonnet to get it to run faster (GREEN)
LEON - development of highlighting AI edits is complete and will be released to beta users soon (for Error Catcher and Translation). Drafting has made it to initial prototype stage. . NB we had an issue with Translation when we moved to DeepL's newest model as it was changing titles and names of people to what was in its training set. We've had to roll back for now. (GREEN) 
LAMP - Added 7 more channels so we are now at 10/29. Retrained the Story Selection model to correct for missing US Politics stories and the Asset Association model to resolve an issue with logo shots not being picked up. (AMBER, should return to GREEN)
AVISTA - We still have issues in production around the length of time things take and the format in which they are produced. Our data science team has made several enhancements so we are going to do another limited test to see if the issues are manageable in order to get something to clients.  (AMBER). Still waiting to get synthetic voice contract signed (AMBER)
Github Copilot - We managed to get all our graphics team on to Github Copilot in March and the feedback is very positive in terms of time saved and more robust, checked coding. ","We are working on a plan to tweak our programme manager role into a hybrid programme/change manager role as she has specific skills in this area. Her goal will be to get the newsroom up to our TR goal of 50% adoption. In March we had a follow-up on comms and training in order to rethink our approach and get beyond the early adopters. This will include (a) setting up a group of AI Champions in Asia, which is often left out of discussions given time zone complexity, (b) starting to do much more focused workshops by team or workflow and (c) upping the case study communications in our W/AI Forward series of emails and website.
LAMP- we have created an Editorial User Guide and we have a SWOT team in place to evaluate the feedback from the team. Depending on the roll-out, this might be the first team where we can free up headcount and move people around. We are monitoring carefully and will take that into consideration as other roles come up in the Bangalore newsroom.","FactGenie - finish integrating the ""link-only"" releases into FactGenie. Integrate a relevance score into FactGenie to help better filter the signal of what should be alerted from the noise of everything that is important in the release. Deliver content from our webwatcher and automations services to FactGenie via a new system to link the pieces together. This will expand FactGenie beyond corporate news to political and economic news and will be a big step forward. This is likely to be tested in Q2 and the rollout starting mid-year. 
LEON: Drafting - Next step is to tune the model to produce four specific story types. Error Catcher: release highlighting functionality to beta users. Translation - release AI editor to French translators and gather feedback to make next decisions e.g. on releasing it directly on to our auto-translations for LSEG. Based on feedback from French, move on to Spanish, Italian, Brazilian Portuguese.
LAMP: Release remaining English channels into LAMP (22 more to go) and release final piece of the AI tooling which ranks stories according to importance, relevance and timeliness. Move on to Top News tool for LSEG's Workspace which is similar but slightly different.
AVISTA - Expand testing group to include another 3-5 users and work out how to publish some of the output to users with disclaimer.

This restricts the range of accessible information as 1) migration of knowledge articles to AEM Guides is not yet complete, resulting in gaps within the knowledge base and 2) doesn’t leverage other possible sources like Salesforce and Flash cases and Flash cases
Mitigation: Complete the migration process by reviewing, categorizing, and publishing all articles in AEM Guides. Explore configurations to enable Salesforce Einstein and Intelligent Assistant to access other data sources like Salesforce cases and Flash cases, thereby enhancing the knowledge base","""•The Intelligent Assistant continues to expand its impact across our support operations, with successful rollouts to Web Services, Cloud Audit Suite, and Fixed Assets products, while training for Cloud Audit Suite representatives remains on track for completion by April's end. Agent satisfaction has improved significantly, with positive feedback increasing from 60% last year to 72% this year, alongside a continued correlation between assistant usage and reduced average handle time (previously observed as a 14% reduction during February despite increased call volumes). Usage rates have held steady at approximately 20% since December. Our upcoming enhancements include a feasibility study for integrating case data for non-GSI users, internal article search functionality scheduled for late Q2 delivery, new content for Web Services and Fixed Asset products, and language localization features. 
• Service Cloud Voice deployed Customer Service  on  April 25th. New  Einstein Next Best Actions,deployed in the same April release. The Q2 Service Cloud Voice deployment for Product Support teams remains on track, and a kick-offs with Product Support leadership teams are underway.
• In March, the call deflection for the WhatsApp-based AI self-service tool for the LatAm region was 30%, showing a slight decline from the previous month. Despite this, 50% of requests were resolved without human interaction, maintaining the same efficiency as in February. Early abandoned contact remained steady at 16%, indicating consistent customer engagement. The average time waiting to interact with an agent after AI interaction was 4.4 minutes, reflecting a satisfactory response rate. The usage of the Product Support Assistant embedded within the product has decreased by 25% month over month but customer engagement showed improvement, with 35% of distinct users opening cases.
• The WhatsApp India Project has been suspended pending  further investigation and legal considerations.  This is likely to be brought back as part of WhatsApp integration with Salesforce planned for 2026 or 2027.
• The Help and Support content team is working to plan and schedule the transition to Adobe's cloud solution (AEM Cloud). This multi-tenant transition must be managed to ensure smooth migration. The team is evaluating an AI solution to identify relevant knowledge base articles for updates and the AI tools that Adobe will provide after migration. These tools are part of our agreement with Adobe. Initial analysis indicates that Adobe's functionality will suffice and offer AI tools for faster authoring and publishing.
•Two initiatives are underway in C2C:
1. The UI/Suspense Payment Application automates payment matching with AI and bots. It reallocates balances to the correct accounts, aiming to reduce cases by 50%. Deployed in the US Legal and LatAm regions, it will expand to ANZ, UK, and Ireland in Q2.
2. The C2C Customer Queries initiative uses LLM to predict customer inquiries. It reduces resolution time from 5 days to 2 in 75% of cases. The project continues in """"Test and Learn"""" and handles around 20,000 queries monthly.
Both initiatives focus on improving efficiency and customer satisfaction.""
","CXD has adopted the TR Enterprise AI OKR for 2025 and will ensure 50% of CXD employees are using Gen AI tools regularly as part of their daily task.  In March  47.3% of CXD employees used AI tools regularly (+ 6.7 pp m/m increase).  We expect this number to continue to rise naturally as we deploy additional AI tools across our CSS agent population the year and use our AI communication channels to promote AI learning opportunities and share innovative and inspiring  ways our colleagues are using AI in their day to day work.  

2025 AI Communications plan was developed and Q1 and is being executed. The CXD AI Atrium page and the first monthly newsletter (AI Spark: AI Innovation in CXD) launched April 15th with AI success stories from across CXD and inspirational video of colleagues using AI in their dat to day tasks.  The first newsletter was a great success with a 76% open rate across ~2,300 recipients. Future newsletters will be supported by an intake process for success stories from across the group. 

A working group is partnering to stand up the Idea Space tool as a way to capture and govern AI ideas across CXD.  An initial version of the tool has been built and is being refined. It is expected the tool will roll out across CXD in May.

Demand for MSFT  365 Copilot licenses remains high as groups find Copilot has proven to be an invaluable tool in streamlining our daily operations. Usage of these licenses is being monitored and remains very high.","•	Intelligent Assistant Expansion: Continue successful rollouts to Web Services, Cloud Audit Suite, and Fixed Assets, with a focus on enhancing agent satisfaction and reducing average handle times.

"April 2025","GTM - Corporates","4/28/2025","[]","Green - As per plan or better","As we move into 2025, our corporate AI strategy remains focused on leveraging internal and third-party tools to drive productivity gains, operational efficiencies, and enhanced customer satisfaction, ultimately improving Net Revenue Retention. Our key objectives are to maximize the potential of our existing tools, particularly Salesforce and Gainsight, and identify areas where additional solutions can further support our goals.

Current Progress and Initiatives:
We are optimizing the use of tools like MS Copilot, with expanded access across the organization, to enhance productivity and efficiency.
Our Professional Services team is actively working on two projects aimed at driving productivity gains, with an additional nine projects in the scoping phase for future development.

Gong: A pilot of Gong was conducted in Q4-2024, with 20 out of 40 participants actively engaging. As of February 27, 2025, Corporates is moving forward with 633 Gong licenses and as of April 28, another 100 licenses has been requested and implementation has begun. 

Future Direction:
Our strategy for 2025 is to continue to fully utilize our current tools and assess potential gaps that may be addressed through additional solutions.
We will prioritize initiatives that drive tangible productivity gains, operational efficiencies, and customer satisfaction improvements, ultimately supporting our Net Revenue Retention goals.

By building on our existing foundation and strategically investing in AI-powered tools and initiatives, we are well-positioned to drive business growth, improve customer satisfaction, and maintain our competitive edge in the market.
","The successful execution of our Corporate Internal Gen AI strategy is contingent upon funding for tool access (another $200k scoped for Gong, waitlist building for Copilot), centralized team support and end-user adoption enablement. 

Revenue Intelligence: May 12 launch is dependent on successful release of enhancements 

Centralized Team Support: It was already called out and acknowledged in a February 4 meeting that more support is needed from centralized teams and product owners to drive AI adoption within the tools they support. To ensure end-users are aware of and proficient in using the Gen AI functionality, we require more active engagement and enablement from these teams. This includes supporting the roll out, providing training, documentation, and change management support to facilitate seamless adoption and optimal utilization of our AI-powered tools.

End-User Adoption and Enablement: The effective use of Gainsight, Salesforce, and Conversica, in particular, relies on end-users being aware of the Gen AI functionality and understanding how to leverage it to drive productivity gains and customer satisfaction improvements. Without sufficient training, support and enablement, we risk underutilization of these critical tools, which may negatively impact our ability to achieve our Net Revenue Retention goals.
","Gong implementation started April 7 with a six-week implementation period and 633 licenses for Account Executive (sales), Account Specialist (retention) and Customer Success roles. Another 217 licenses is being scoped for Global Accounts, Solution Consulting and Partnership & Alliances teams - funding TBC. 

Revenue Intelligence: continued reginement on the tool in prep for May 12 launch, finalized channel roll out. 
","There has not been any new change management efforts since the start of 2025. The need has been raised above and will be the responsibility of all to consider the current state and how the solutions help address the current challenges.","As we look to 2025, our path forward is focused on building on the foundation established in 2024, with a emphasis on optimizing the adoption of our current tools, expanding the use of AI-powered solutions, and driving business outcomes through targeted use cases. Key priorities include:

Optimizing Current Tools: We will focus on maximizing the potential of our existing tools, particularly Gainsight, enabling Einstein tools in Salesforce (particularly Revenue Intelligence to launch in late Q1), and Copilot to drive productivity gains, operational efficiencies, and customer satisfaction improvements.

Restarting and Expanding Conversica: We will restart and expand our use of Conversica, leveraging its capabilities to enhance our sales and customer engagement efforts and explore expansion across other teams in Corporates. 

Accelerating Professional Services Use Cases: We will prioritize the development of Professional Services use cases, focusing on internal process improvement initiatives that drive tangible business outcomes. 

Guidance from Corporate Leadership: We will seek guidance from Corporate leadership on the support and resources that will be provided to drive our Corporate Internal Gen AI strategy in 2025. This will ensure that our efforts are aligned with organizational priorities and that we have the necessary backing to achieve our objectives.

Gong: Rollout plan for Gong will follow as we move forward with 633 licenses to cover all Account Executives, Account Specialists, Customer Success Managers and their respective managers.

Integrate a relevance score into FactGenie to help better filter the signal of what should be alerted from the noise of everything that is important in the release. Deliver content from our webwatcher and automations services to FactGenie via a new system to link the pieces together. This will expand FactGenie beyond corporate news to political and economic news and will be a big step forward. This is likely to be tested in Q2 and the rollout starting mid-year. 
LEON: Drafting - Next step is to tune the model to produce four specific story types. Error Catcher: release highlighting functionality to beta users. Translation - release AI editor to French translators and gather feedback to make next decisions e.g. on releasing it directly on to our auto-translations for LSEG. Based on feedback from French, move on to Spanish, Italian, Brazilian Portuguese.
LAMP: Release remaining English channels into LAMP (22 more to go) and release final piece of the AI tooling which ranks stories according to importance, relevance and timeliness. Move on to Top News tool for LSEG's Workspace which is similar but slightly different.
AVISTA - Expand testing group to include another 3-5 users and work out how to publish some of the output to users with disclaimer.

"May 2025","GTM - Corporates","6/3/2025","[]","Green - As per plan or better","As we move into 2025, our corporate AI strategy remains focused on leveraging internal and third-party tools to drive productivity gains, operational efficiencies, and enhanced customer satisfaction, ultimately improving Net Revenue Retention. Our key objectives are to maximize the potential of our existing tools, particularly Salesforce and Gainsight, and identify areas where additional solutions can further support our goals.

Current Progress and Initiatives:
We are optimizing the use of tools like MS Copilot, with expanded access across the organization, to enhance productivity and efficiency.
Copilot and Open Arena continue to be the most widely adopted GenAI tools across Corporates. 

Gong: A pilot of Gong was conducted in Q4-2024, with 20 out of 40 participants actively engaging. In Februaru, Corporates decided to move forward with 633 Gong and launch is set for June 3.  

Future Direction:
Our strategy for 2025 is to continue to fully utilize our current tools and assess potential gaps that may be addressed through additional solutions.
We will prioritize initiatives that drive tangible productivity gains, operational efficiencies, and customer satisfaction improvements, ultimately supporting our Net Revenue Retention goals.

By building on our existing foundation and strategically investing in AI-powered tools and initiatives, we are well-positioned to drive business growth, improve customer satisfaction, and maintain our competitive edge in the market.
","The successful execution of our Corporate Internal Gen AI strategy is contingent upon funding for tool access (another $200k scoped for Gong, waitlist building for Copilot), centralized team support and end-user adoption enablement. 

Revenue Intelligence: May 12 launch was pushed - launch TBC.  

Centralized Team Support: It was already called out and acknowledged in a February 4 meeting that more support is needed from centralized teams and product owners to drive AI adoption within the tools they support. To ensure end-users are aware of and proficient in using the Gen AI functionality, we require more active engagement and enablement from these teams. This includes supporting the roll out, providing training, documentation, and change management support to facilitate seamless adoption and optimal utilization of our AI-powered tools.

End-User Adoption and Enablement: The effective use of Gainsight, Salesforce, and Conversica, in particular, relies on end-users being aware of the Gen AI functionality and understanding how to leverage it to drive productivity gains and customer satisfaction improvements. Without sufficient training, support and enablement, we risk underutilization of these critical tools, which may negatively impact our ability to achieve our Net Revenue Retention goals.
","Gong implementation started April 7 with a six-week implementation period and 633 licenses for Account Executive (sales), Account Specialist (retention) and Customer Success roles. Another 217 licenses is being scoped for Global Accounts, Solution Consulting and Partnership & Alliances teams - funding TBC and based on successful wave one launch. Gong launches to Corporates starting Tuesday, June 3. 

Revenue Intelligence: continued reginement on the tool in prep for May 12 launch, finalized channel roll out. 
","There has not been any new change management efforts since the start of 2025. The need has been raised above and will be the responsibility of all to consider the current state and how the solutions help address the current challenges.","As we look to 2025, our path forward is focused on building on the foundation established in 2024, with a emphasis on optimizing the adoption of our current tools, expanding the use of AI-powered solutions, and driving business outcomes through targeted use cases. Key priorities include:

Optimizing Current Tools: We will focus on maximizing the potential of our existing tools, particularly Gainsight, enabling Einstein tools in Salesforce (particularly Revenue Intelligence to launch in late Q1), and Copilot to drive productivity gains, operational efficiencies, and customer satisfaction improvements.

Restarting and Expanding Conversica: We will restart and expand our use of Conversica, leveraging its capabilities to enhance our sales and customer engagement efforts and explore expansion across other teams in Corporates. 

Accelerating Professional Services Use Cases: We will prioritize the development of Professional Services use cases, focusing on internal process improvement initiatives that drive tangible business outcomes. 

Guidance from Corporate Leadership: We will seek guidance from Corporate leadership on the support and resources that will be provided to drive our Corporate Internal Gen AI strategy in 2025. This will ensure that our efforts are aligned with organizational priorities and that we have the necessary backing to achieve our objectives.

Gong: Rollout plan for Gong will follow as we move forward with 633 licenses to cover all Account Executives, Account Specialists, Customer Success Managers and their respective managers.

Will continue to assess scope/usage and perform tests and experiments into second half of 2025.  Will assess financial savings in Q3/Q4 2025.","RISK: Dynamic nature of product management role and activity, based on outcomes rather than outputs, make harder to find one single metric that can be utilized to single out efficiency gains by using AI. While we see the adoption of AI in these roles, it’s harder to estimate impact only based on time-savings dimension.
RISK: Also connected with the above, there are limited specific AI tools for Product Managers, and some may even increase complexity or force strict processes. While we evaluate options to bring a tool/system for PMs, our current hypothesis is that generic tools (like Copilot / Claude / OpenAI) might be best suited for the role – and we may create specific prompts or agents for the specific use cases that we target.


","Four product manager use cases are being tracked in Launch stage and six in Ideation stage to be integrated into the product management workflow in support of the Product Operating Model. Product Requirements Document (PRD) Assistant and ADO User Story Builder launched, and ADO Epic & Feature Builder and Release Notes Generator are in beta, all leveraging both Open Arena and Copilot Chat Agent tools on the Atrium, promoted to the Innovation Team and product management Copilot license holders for feedback. 

Three Product Design use cases (AI Assisted Research, Design, and Frontend Engineering) remain in experimentation phase. We’re continuing AI-assisted design and front end engineering experimentation with a focus on Prototyping+, including active discovery with v0 by Vercel with onboarding and training in mid-June. Usage stats for AI Assisted Research via Stravito AI Insights are now enabled to support Product Design metrics in the TR AI Adoption dashboard.

In Product Content, we developed the requirements for the TaxLaw2Code project for analyzing differences and will begin the design work for creating ADO tickets automatically from the annotations. In addition, the Lead Tax Analysts are using Materia in their tax research. Finally, we have hired in May an AI Program Manager to identify all use cases, prioritize based on impact, and work towards implementation.  

Three Tax Research (Content) use cases are being tracked in the experimentation stage: TaxLaw2Code (ADO), Release Notes AI Creation, and Modernize iDesign Development Tool.  Given the constraints on Lab resources, we are working with AWS on a workshop to work on a backwards approach for a 'day in the life' for direct tax, indirect tax, and global trade. This will allow us to uncover additional use cases.  For the Modernize iDesign Development tool, we have received some EPC funding to begin the work in 2025 but will take 12-18 months.","Product Management, Design and Tax Research are focused on engagement for product manager-focused solutions via comms, Atrium page launch, Innovation Team and Copilot tester activation and promotion. ","Product Management path forward is to enhance existing AI solutions via Open Arena models and Copilot capabilities, while continuing innovation discovery and experimentation toward development of new use cases following the Product Operating Model, and in parallel exploring third-party AI tools.

Product Design’s path forward is to continue advancing experimentation with a focus on business-aligned pilots, prioritizing the selection of a strategic AI-assisted prototyping tool—v0, Lovable, or Figma Make—by Q3.

For Tax Research (Content), we are hiring a Program Manager to work on identifying all use cases across the organization in order to prioritize, determine impact, and ascertain resources.  With the number of regulatory changes in Q1, we have not been able to spend as much time moving projects forward. This Program Manager will drive the cases in development.

In May, we conducted extensive testing with engineering teams across Product Engineering, including Research teams, successfully evaluating Cursor, ClaudeCode, and Cline.
 
Cursor has received positive feedback from participants who preferred it over GitHub Copilot (GHCP). The rollout is scheduled to begin in the first week of June, with an initial procurement of 300 licenses at an annual cost of $32 each, representing 20% of the full price.
 
We are collaborating with the CIO, Internal AI, and ETS teams to integrate usage metrics for Cursor, ClaudeCode, and Cline by June 30th. Additionally, we are testing the performance of these tools across various development activities, including KTLO Enhancements, New Feature Development, and Quality Engineering.
 
Internal AI has released a usage dashboard for individuals and managers to monitor AI DevTools usage, with plans to add Cursor, ClaudeCode, and Cline data in June. The CIO team has identified a few issues with GHCP under usage reporting. They are currently investigating these issues and have raised a ticket with Microsoft for further assistance. We continue to push the teams to deliver this as quickly as possible.","1. Cline offers potential for faster code development, but carries risks of IP loss and harm to TR systems. To mitigate these, we propose limiting use to internal LLMs, employing development containers for isolation, and implementing robust auditing.
You can find guidelines here: https://trten.sharepoint.com/sites/intr-isrm-business-and-product-security/SitePages/Securing-the-AI-coding-tool-chain.aspx
2.  Developer surveys indicate that while AI can suggest boilerplate code, it lacks the ability to ideate or strategize. Therefore, it is crucial to maintain a human in the loop for editing and guiding the output of AI, rather than relying on it solely as a source of output.","1.

"June 2025","People / Comms","7/2/2025","[]","Green - As per plan or better","Talent Acquisition continues to advance multiple AI initiatives with measurable progress. The LinkedIn Hiring Assistant pilot with 20 recruiters has successfully generated 12 hires, while BrightHire pilot testing remains active pending Workday integration. The Open Arena-powered AI Recruiter Summary tool is live but experiencing low adoption rates, prompting a review of user feedback to enhance questioning capabilities and response generation. HiredScore exploration continues with the business case under finance and digital team review since April.

HR Services has achieved significant milestones across three key areas. Content Management & Experience completed governance tool demos and incorporated Workday Governance team feedback into taxonomy proposals, while developing approaches for Atrium navigation optimization. Global HR Services successfully moved key case management enhancements to production and completed current state analysis for DIS centralization with team training underway. HRX Regional HR established project scope and roadmap with a core team kickoff planned for June 2025.

Communications expanded AI experimentation significantly, completing testing on 27 use cases across multiple tools (Open Arena, Copilot, DAVE AI, Signal AI, Appreciate AI) with 10 additional cases in pipeline. The team gained DAVE AI access and is planning training sessions while continuously refining the communications prompt library for global team use. Chain creation in Open Arena is progressing for executive messaging and communications planning applications.

Other AI Experimentation encompasses diverse initiatives showing varied progress. My AI Coach is preparing for mid-year check-in launch to support performance conversations, while Talent Highlights remains on hold due to eligibility restrictions affecting 62% of employees until Workday's 2026R1 solution. CoCounsel expanded with 30 new HR users trained, and Copilot achieved 6,700+ interactions in May with all 78 PCSI licenses actively utilized. Workday illuminate now supports 17 task assistants in production, demonstrating significant case volume reduction potential based on customer success stories.","Talent Acquisition faces technical and adoption challenges that could impact timeline delivery. Data privacy and CIO support confirmation for BrightHire's Workday production integration remains pending. Heavy reliance on capacity-constrained internal technical partners for AI Concept Hub development and Digital HR implementations poses delivery risks. Additionally, typical recruiter adoption patterns suggest months-long integration periods for new tools to become part of daily workflows.

HR Services encounters operational and coordination risks across workstreams. Content Management & Experience must address article naming mismatches with attached PDFs requiring correction. Global HR Services faces potential workload and efficiency impacts if implementation changes aren't executed smoothly. HRX Regional HR anticipates possible delays in role-based task analysis completion due to competing priorities, though clear project kickoff expectations aim to mitigate this risk.

Communications experiences resource allocation and priority management challenges. Delivery pressures create reluctance to interrupt current work for testing alternative approaches, while critical priorities consistently take precedence over AI workstream activities. Time constraints and competing demands limit experimentation capacity and tool adoption rates.","See Internal AI Use Cases Tab","Talent Acquisition maintains comprehensive communication and training strategies across multiple channels. Continuous messaging on AI use cases occurs through AI Explorers supplementing All Hands meetings, individual team sessions, and Recruiting Collective Teams communications. Bi-weekly TA Office Hours provide dedicated forums for AI application sharing and Q&A sessions. Each rollout and pilot receives individual launch treatment with associated communication and training programs to ensure proper adoption.

HR Services employs stakeholder-focused engagement strategies tailored to each workstream. Content Management & Experience engages governance framework subject matter experts on their roles for building Workday and Atrium governance policies. Global HR Services conducts stakeholder meetings and shares executive summaries to align goals while actively involving GHS team members in discovery, validation, and testing phases. The approach includes training and upskilling initiatives to support team adaptation. HRX Regional HR engaged leadership teams to increase workstream visibility and identified the need for coordinated change management strategies with GHS due to interdependencies.

Communications builds upon 2024 foundations while addressing identified challenges. The team established four key focus areas (Content Development, Communications Planning, Sentiment Analysis, Translations) carried into 2025, adding Data Analysis and Workflow Enhancement Tools. Change management leverages existing touchpoints including AI as recurring All Hands agenda topics and weekly communications meeting demos. Key challenges include highly skilled teams delivering administrative tasks traditionally and limited AI usage in data gathering and analysis, addressed through updated prompt libraries and accessible global team resources.","Talent Acquisition will focus on driving adoption of existing tools while expanding capabilities. Priority actions include monitoring AI Recruiter Summary adoption through targeted messaging, completing LinkedIn Hiring Assistant implementation and pilot monitoring, and finalizing HiredScore evaluation alongside Workday renewal discussions. Development of intake session recording and summarization tools will enhance recruiter efficiency.

HR Services will advance multiple strategic initiatives across all workstreams. Content Management & Experience will confirm taxonomy with portfolio leads, showcase governance tools to leadership, and develop business proposals for Workday content access optimization and Atrium user experience improvements. Global HR Services will review security roles and case routing patterns for consolidation while realigning Workday access for DIS work integration. HRX Regional HR will complete role-based task analysis, assess regional function transitions, and identify automation opportunities and appropriate role placements.

Communications will continue systematic testing and evaluation while expanding tool adoption. Key priorities include testing video creation using Adobe Express, strategizing Q2 task execution, and enhancing AI awareness across communications teams. The team will identify additional AI applications across Thomson Reuters, leverage training opportunities for existing tools, refine usage and productivity measurement methodology, and share best practices through town halls and office hours.

Other AI Experimentation will focus on optimization and expansion of successful initiatives. AI Coaching will refresh 2025 roadmap, address user feedback, and develop sustainable testing strategies. CoCounsel will identify targeted HR use cases and expand through customer success planning. People.ai will enhance content governance and data visualization capabilities, while Workday illuminate will continue expanding task assistant functionality and M365 Copilot will progress through design partner testing.","Morse, Jonathan R.

Will continue to assess scope/usage and perform tests and experiments into second half of 2025.  Will assess financial savings in Q3/Q4 2025.","RISK: Dynamic nature of product management role and activity, based on outcomes rather than outputs, make harder to find one single metric that can be utilized to single out efficiency gains by using AI. While we see the adoption of AI in these roles, it’s harder to estimate impact only based on time-savings dimension.
RISK: Also connected with the above, there are limited specific AI tools for Product Managers, and some may even increase complexity or force strict processes. While we evaluate options to implement a no-code prototyping tool or product management system, our current hypothesis is that generic tools (like Copilot / AI Platform Open Arena) might be best suited for the role – and we may create specific prompts or agents for the specific use cases that we target.


","Five Product Manager use cases are being tracked in Launch stage, three in the Experimentation stage, and five in Ideation stage to be integrated into the product management workflow in support of the Product Operating Model. Product Requirements Document (PRD) Assistant and ADO User Story Builder, ADO Epic & Feature Builder, and Release Notes Generator are Launched, all leveraging both Open Arena and Copilot Chat Agent tools promoted on the Atrium, to the Innovation Team, and Product Manager Copilot license holders for feedback. 

Product Design continued AI-assisted prototyping experiments focusing on the “Prototyping+” use case. In mid-June, the team kicked off an active discovery with Vercel’s v0 tool, including onboarding and training sessions spanning design, engineering, product management, as well the Tax Frisco Summer intern program. This culminated in presentations by high school interns using v0 for the first time as well as an internal hackathon-style evaluation where cross-functional teams rapidly built high-fidelity prototypes using natural language prompts building working prototypes 6x faster. The Prototyping+ pilot continues into July with a larger evaluator cohort. Results from this trial (e.g. survey feedback, prototype examples, time-savings metrics) will inform a recommendation on AI-Assisted Prototyping+ tool adoption for Product Design. The design research function made strides in using AI to accelerate user experience (UX) research. In June, the team operationalized this capability and began measuring its adoption and impact.

In Product Content, we developed the requirements for the TaxLaw2Code project for analyzing differences and will begin the design work for creating ADO tickets automatically from the annotations. In addition, the Lead Tax Analysts are using Materia in their tax research. Finally, we have hired in May an AI Program Manager to identify all use cases, prioritize based on impact, and work towards implementation.  In June, we held an AI workshop with AWS to refine the requirements for TaxLaw2Code. Beyond the structured outcomes, the workshop yielded valuable, unexpected benefits. Participants experienced strengthened relationships and the deep satisfaction of achieving alignment. This human interaction is crucial for true transformation, fostering trust and a shared sense of purpose that extends beyond the official goals of the workshop.","Product Management, Design and Tax Research are focused on engagement for product manager and design-focused solutions via comms, Atrium page and Viva Engage community launch, Innovation Teams, office hours, AI solution and tools focused trainings, and expansion of Copilot license activation and promotion. ","Product Management path forward is to enhance existing AI solutions via Open Arena models and Copilot capabilities, while continuing innovation discovery and experimentation toward development of new use cases following the Product Operating Model, and in parallel exploring external AI-prototyping tools to be included in upcoming ""future of product management"" trials, in collaboration with Design and Product Engineering cross-functional partners.

Product Design’s path forward is to continue advancing experimentation with a focus on business-aligned pilots for early adopters across the organization, prioritizing the selection of a strategic AI-assisted prototyping tool—v0, Lovable, or Figma Make—by Q3.

For Tax Research (Content), we are working on Phase II of TaxLaw2Code in Q3 with the creation of ADO tickets with user story requirements. In addition, we are working to secure an AI Engineer resource to allow for work to begin on Phase III which will allow recommendations to be rendered to Analyst on the needed changes to logic.

It was necessary additional alignments within the provider to understand what capabilities we should expect to test since not all the functionalities will be available since we are not going to connect Gong with the local CRMs we have in the Region. ​

The decision was made to move forward with the pilot without having additional projects being required and test only the functionalities that are available in this model.","During the first discussions of the pilot, we’ve identified that Gong cannot connect the same instance of the tool with difference SFDC instances. Since Latam users are on S2E SFDC instance or SGD as their CRMs, we needed to understand the capabilities / options to be considered under the pilot scope before moving forward. ​

We explored the different options for your Gong implementation, including setting up a new instance, using the existing GSI Salesforce instance, or waiting for another time. ​

We reviewed a comparison matrix of Gong features that would be available under each option, highlighting the limitations of the existing GSI instance in terms of account-based functionality. ​

We will need to have a local person trained by the Gong team due to language limitation, with that our launch will be postponed, since there is the need of a new SOW for the train the trainer program.","Licenses were sent to all 10 users.​

The Train the trainer session was held on December 3rd. ​

We will now translate the training material and schedule local session in Portuguese and Spanish.​

Not enough Copilot licenses for everyone that wants one. Including our rep that handles the Microsoft account!
2. Friction in getting Gong adopted (lots of steps to setup a call, customers not willing to give consent to be recorded, etc)
3. Collaborative forecasting capabilities not robust enough at the moment for full adoption, waiting on phase 2 enhancements
4. Not getting enough data to be ingested by our internal AI tools to help the field (i.e. Seismic data in Copilot Studio)","Collaborative Forecasting and Gong was rolled out to Corporates in late May/early June. We're still working through some early implementation troubles in order to get the tools fully adopted by our field. 

Due to hierarchy issues, Revenue Intelligence rollout was delayed until mid-July and Path to Plan is delayed to late July.

Corporates Command Center (taking a page out of LP's franchise playbook) was rolled out to all the leaders within Corporates in May. CC is a collection of the main dashboards that the leaders use to run their business. Access requires CRMA license and we've worked through a number of license shortage issues so far.

Corporates have 5 massive playbooks on the Atrium site as a one stop shop for our sellers to learn about all they need to know to effectively sell our products. As expected, the playbooks are too heavy for reps to consume so the Enablement team built the Enablement Navigator chatbot in Copilot Studio for front line employees to query the chatbot for their sales questions. So far, the chatbot was released to select people on the front lines and it's been receiving great reviews. We're looking for more content for this chatbot to consume, including content that's loaded in Seismic, and any internal documentation on driving a deal through our various systems.","Working closely with CE on Gong and Collaborative Forecast adoption. Developing playbooks for new tech rollout","Coming into July, we will look to recycle our Copilot licenses to those that have requested licenses as well as ways to get more licenses.

Microsoft Co Pilot for Finance  ( Finance AI agent ) :  the out of box functionality is not fit for purpose for Finance user cases.

Ongoing change management efforts include continuous messaging and education about AI use cases via AI Explorers, all-hands meetings, and dedicated forums such as bi-weekly office hours. Each pilot or rollout is treated as a distinct change initiative, with tailored communication and training to drive adoption and user comfort.

Other AI Experimentation:
Engagement and adoption are being promoted through orientation sessions (e.g., for CoCounsel), ongoing feedback collection (e.g., for My AI Coach), and targeted expansion efforts for tools like People.ai and Workday AI features. Looking ahead, change management will continue to emphasize embedding new tools into core processes, tracking adoption metrics, and proactively addressing any challenges as they arise in explicit coordination with stakeholder groups.","Next steps include finalizing and implementing taxonomy and metadata standards, supporting Atrium HR content clean-up, and advancing navigation enhancements.

The complexity of the problem the Content Innovation team in our Content Engineering organization has developed a solution for revolutionizes both the approach to creating this content, but as importantly it will allow us to transform this product offering into a much more current and timelier content product for the benefit of our customers.  The build to bring this game changing approach to production is currently underway.

Additionally in the Commentary space, the updating mechanism for this content, that pulls in the critical case updates for our customers, has been significantly improved with Gen AI.  The build to bring this to production is also in progress.

In our Practical Law space, the Content Updating use case also saw a leap forward as critical components of the end-to-end solution have been established as feasible and additional evaluation and refinement is now underway.  

Finally, both of the Editorial Assistant use cases which support our Practical Law Editors have advanced to build integration phases.

","New lead of Editorial Change Management has been added to the Editorial Strategy organization, and we are partnering closely to further our progress in this area.
","Each of our large build projects are in different stages of the build process - but whether they are in the evaluation/refinement phase, UX design phase, integration phase, or re-visiting certain models based on user testing and feedback - each are moving forward.

Key risks related to knowledge article categorization and data source breadth have been addressed, with improved Salesforce integration and robust categorization systems now in place. Looking ahead, the focus will be on expanding internal content for Intelligent Assistant, completing the Service Cloud Voice deployment, accelerating the transition to AEM Cloud, and broadening the reach of successful AI initiatives to drive continued efficiency and customer satisfaction.","
Effectiveness of our AI knowledge tools is being impacted by several issues.
Issue 1:  Help and Support content was written for web presentation to customers and is not categorized in a way that Salesforce understands, leading to inefficiencies in search and in some cases resulting in incorrect articles being returned by Einstein
Mitigation: Implement a robust categorization system that aligns with Salesforce's requirements. Enhance search functionalities by making filters sticky and improving the initial global search results. Regularly review and update the categorization to ensure it remains effective
Update:  Categorization functionality in Salesforce on track to release July 12th.  Content will need to be subsequently categorized and republished.  COMPLETE.  Closed.

Issue 2:  Intelligent Assistant and Salesforce Einstein are exclusively limited to knowledge articles and do not utilize other data sources in their AI learning.  This restricts the range of accessible information as 1) migration of knowledge articles to AEM Guides is not yet complete, resulting in gaps within the knowledge base and 2) doesn’t leverage other possible sources like Salesforce and Flash cases.
Mitigation: Complete the migration process by reviewing, categorizing, and publishing all articles in AEM Guides. Explore configurations to enable Salesforce Einstein and Intelligent Assistant to access other data sources like Salesforce cases and Flash cases, thereby enhancing the knowledge base
Update: Salesforce Sherlock is being leveraged to return Gen AI answers based on case data for GST/OIT users.  Testing is nearing completion and agents should be trained and using the tool by August 1. COMPLETE.  Closed.","Chatbot 2.0: 
•	Chatbot 2.0 for UltraTax aims to launch before fall peak, introducing generative AI to replace the current menu-driven experience, but faces concerns about accuracy rates and the risks of coinciding with a core platform upgrade.Team is working for increased answer accuracy (closer to 80%) and robust monitoring before  a go-live decision will be made.

Will assess financial savings in Q3/Q4 2025.","RISK: Dynamic nature of product management role and activity, based on outcomes rather than outputs, make harder to find one single metric that can be utilized to single out efficiency gains by using AI. While we see the adoption of AI in these roles, it’s harder to estimate impact only based on time-savings dimension.
RISK: Also connected with the above, there are limited specific AI tools for Product Managers, and some may even increase complexity or force strict processes. While we evaluate options to implement a no-code prototyping tool or product management system, our current hypothesis is that generic tools (like Copilot / AI Platform Open Arena) might be best suited for the role – and we may create specific prompts or agents for the specific use cases that we target.
RISK: To find funding this year to build from use case ide to actual implementation of an AI agent doing the workflow, we will have to find funding in the current budget which means holding on backfills. We are working to not cause any issues with upcoming regulatory updates but time to market might be impacted. Will do our very best to mitigate but hard decisions will need to take place for the long-term good.


","Five Product Manager use cases are being tracked in Launch stage, three in the Experimentation stage, and five in Ideation stage to be integrated into the product management workflow in support of the Product Operating Model. Product Requirements Document (PRD) Assistant and ADO User Story Builder, ADO Epic & Feature Builder, and Release Notes Generator are Launched, all leveraging both Open Arena and Copilot Chat Agent tools promoted on the Atrium, to the Innovation Team, and Product Manager Copilot license holders for feedback.

Product Design launched trial licenses and proof-of-concept evaluation for low-code vibe coding tools v0 and Lovable, with Product Design use cases submitted for license request categorized into four themes: prototyping and design-to-code, accessibility, AI-enhanced workflows, and speed and collaboration. Cross-functional weekly sessions were initiated to foster experiential learning through mini-hackathon-style activities, demos, and vendor Q&A sessions. Post evaluation surveys will be collected to inform recommendations. UX Engineering expanded use of GitHub Copilot, particularly in Coding Agent mode, for agent-assisted development. The Research team continues to evaluate Stravito AI, Copilot Researcher, and Analyst, reporting quality aggregation and insight generation from the tools. Content is evaluating Open Arena chains for lightweight content validation, while Operations introduced a Copilot-integrated Power BI dashboard to enable richer insights using natural language. 

In Product Content, we developed the requirements for the TaxLaw2Code project for analyzing differences and will begin the design work for creating ADO tickets automatically from the annotations. In addition, the Lead Tax Analysts are using Materia in their tax research. Finally, we have hired an AI Program Manager to identify all use cases, prioritize based on impact, and work towards implementation.  In June, we held an AI workshop with AWS to refine the requirements for TaxLaw2Code. Beyond the structured outcomes, the workshop yielded valuable, unexpected benefits. Participants experienced strengthened relationships and the deep satisfaction of achieving alignment. This human interaction is crucial for true transformation, fostering trust and a shared sense of purpose that extends beyond the official goals of the workshop.","Product Management, Design and Tax Research are focused on engagement for product manager and design-focused solutions via comms, Atrium page and Viva Engage community launch, Innovation Teams, office hours, AI solution and tools focused trainings, expansion of Copilot license activation and promotion.","Product Management path forward is to enhance existing AI solutions via Open Arena models and Copilot capabilities, while continuing innovation discovery and experimentation toward development of new use cases following the Product Operating Model, and in parallel exploring external AI-prototyping tools via ""future of product management"" tools trials, in collaboration with Design and Product Engineering cross-functional partners.

Product Design’s path forward is to continue advancing experimentation with a focus on business-aligned pilots for early adopters across the organization, prioritizing the selection of a strategic AI-assisted prototyping tool—v0, Lovable, or Figma Make—by Q3. Inform recommendation toward the adoption selected Research and Design vendor related tools in trial.

Product Content's path forward is to finalize the top 5 AI use cases based on impact and provide the funding needed to move those to implementation in Q4 of 2025.  With the type of work done, we cannot purchase off the shelf software so will need to be built based on custom workflows and/or partnership with a third-party. 

For Tax Research (Content), we are working on Phase II of TaxLaw2Code in Q3 with the creation of ADO tickets with user story requirements.

Communications faces competing priorities and delivery pressures, which limit bandwidth for AI experimentation and process change.

HR Services is managing regional differences in validation processes, pending access revocation, and workflow variations that could delay automation and standardization efforts. The HRX workstream is addressing high task volumes and team availability constraints, which may impact deadlines for final recommendations and task transitions. Effective buy-in from receiving teams and standardization of region-specific processes remain critical for smooth implementation. No specific risks or issues were reported for Other AI Experimentation.","See Internal AI Use Cases Tab","Change management efforts have been robust across PCSI, with targeted communication and training plans supporting AI rollouts and process transitions.

Proactive planning and coordination are underway in HRX to socialize recommendations and ensure smooth transitions, including early engagement with digital automation leads. No significant change management activities were reported for Other AI Experimentation during this period.

Across all workstreams, the emphasis on proactive communication, stakeholder engagement, and tailored training has supported the adoption and integration of AI solutions within PCSI. By maintaining structured rollout plans and leveraging regular forums for feedback and knowledge sharing, the function is positioned to manage ongoing change effectively while preparing for broader implementation of future AI enhancements.","Looking ahead, each workstream will continue to progress independently, with a clear emphasis on completing active pilots, evaluating their impact, and determining next steps for broader deployment.

Will continue to assess scope/usage and perform tests and experiments into second half of 2025.  The teams are building AI Chains and Chatbots into the current workflows.  ","RISK: Dynamic nature of product management role and activity, based on outcomes rather than outputs, make harder to find one single metric that can be utilized to single out efficiency gains by using AI. While we see the adoption of AI in these roles, it’s harder to estimate impact only based on time-savings dimension.
RISK: Also connected with the above, there are limited specific AI tools for Product Managers, and some may even increase complexity or force strict processes. While we evaluate options to implement a no-code prototyping tool or product management system, our current hypothesis is that generic tools (like Copilot / AI Platform Open Arena) might be best suited for the role – and we may create specific prompts or agents for the specific use cases that we target.


","Five Product Manager use cases are being tracked in Launch stage, three in the Experimentation stage, and five in Ideation stage to be integrated into the product management workflow in support of the Product Operating Model. Product Requirements Document (PRD) Assistant and ADO User Story Builder, ADO Epic & Feature Builder, and Release Notes Generator are Launched, all leveraging both Open Arena and Copilot Chat Agent tools promoted on the Atrium, to the Innovation Team, and Product Manager Copilot license holders for feedback. AI for Product Management Tools Trial is in progress, examining via POC 4 no-code AI prototyping tools for product manager use; recommendation ETA by end of Sept.

Product Design continues to advance AI-assisted prototyping through the ongoing “Prototyping+” program trial. In August, the team expanded participation across design, engineering, product management, and executive leadership onboarding, learning, and experimenting with multiple tools. six core use-case domains have emerged across teams trialing the tools including realistic design exploration, accessibility reviews, smoother engineering handoff of which are all showing early signs of accelerating communication and improving cross-functional collaboration. The trial remains active, with additional feedback and tool evaluations expected through September. These efforts directly support the Product Operating Model by embedding prototyping into early-stage workflows and are showing signs of enabling faster, more informed decision-making across teams. Teams are exploring the use of model context protocol (MCP) for integrating multiple systems using developer tools with the paella project. The Centralized IP project is evolving, incorporating integrations with AskJulius and Figma as starting points. The design research function is partnering to explore opportunities for a Research Bank Hackathon project to explore bringing research content and AI synthesis in-house.

In Tax Content Research, we have developed a comprehensive list of AI use cases across all of the teams.  We have prioritized the top cases that will have the largest impact.  We are actively working 10 use cases and have implemented 4 of these in the month of September.  We are mapping the roles across the organization to analyze where there is whitespace that we need to determine how AI can be incorporated into the development workflow.  ","Product Management, Design and Tax Research are focused on engagement for product manager, content analysts, and design-focused solutions via comms, Atrium page and Viva Engage community launch, Innovation Teams, office hours, AI solution and tools focused trainings, expansion of Copilot license activation and promotion, and 3rd party tools trials.  In addition, for Tax & Trade Content Research, we are working to reimagine 2-3 workflows across OSR, Direct Tax, and Indirect Tax. From this, we will determine what additional skills are needed to build agents.  ","Product Management path forward is to enhance existing AI solutions via Open Arena models and Copilot capabilities, while continuing innovation discovery and experimentation toward development of new use cases following the Product Operating Model, and in parallel exploring external AI-prototyping tools via ""future of product management"" tools trials, in collaboration with Design and Product Engineering cross-functional partners.

Product Design’s path forward is to continue advancing experimentation with a focus on business-aligned pilots for early adopters across the organization, prioritizing the selection of a strategic AI-assisted prototyping tools and business use cases.

For Tax Research (Content), we are continuing to work on progress with the development of AI chains for the use cases prioritized.  We are determining if there are additional skillsets we need to hire for to accelerate AI implementation. We have mastered AI Chains and have incorporated several into the processes.

CoCounsel 2.0 was deployed in Q1, with CoCounsel Drafting scheduled for deployment by the end of Q3-2025. An updated CoCounsel Prompts Library will be deployed to support Sourcing and Supplier & Contract Managers on their contract review and contract drafting activities. The primary focus for these teams will be Contract Comparison documents, which represents the most time-consuming task in their workflow.

Continuous Improvement Plan (Q4): The CoCounsel Drafting strategy includes potential integrations with Contract Express for template automation and Practical Law for legal playbook automation.

2. RFP Template Generation MVP

The solution is being split into two distinct use cases:

2.1 RFP Proposal Responses Summarization (Delivery: September 2025):
Specific Outcomes: Versatile proposal summarization AI workflow adaptable to multiple proposal categories while maintaining quality standards
MVP Definition: Initial version with clear boundaries around proposal types and complexity levels
Continuous Improvement Plan: Extended version with an AI Agent featuring real-time guidance and RFP FAQ automation

2.2 Intelligent RFP Template Generator (Delivery: Q4 2025):
Concept: Prompt-based testing with available LLMs will assess the feasibility and quality of AI-generated RFP content. If AI output proves unsatisfactory, focus will shift to developing modular, category-specific templates
The original MVP for collaborative RFP template generation was successfully configured in Kronos V2, with UAT completed in May and go-live achieved in the last week of June. With our expertise in Copilot Studio, we are now scaling the solution for comprehensive RFP analysis and generation.

3. Services Gateway Chatbot Development

This development is being split into separate AI agents:

3.1 Travel & Expenses Agent: Deployment scheduled for September 2025

3.2 Procurement Agent:
Focus: E2E Process Orchestration
Specific Outcomes: Intelligent agent streamlining end-to-end procurement journey with real-time guidance and FAQ automation
MVP Definition: AI agent in Copilot Studio orchestrating procurement workflows, integrating with existing H2O systems
Timeline: MVP delivery by end of September with continuous improvements in Q4
Continuous Improvement Plan: Incorporate new procurement policy for compliance capabilities upon availability
We are currently developing our internal governance model for AI agents and compiling a comprehensive list of potential use cases to be developed through Q3-H1 2026.","- Complex system integration risks: Integrating the AI solutions with existing systems, databases, and workflows.​
- User Adoption and change management risks: Resistance to change or difficulties in understanding and using the new solution could hinder project success.​
- Technical risk: Algorithm complexity could delay or impact the effectiveness of the solution.""
","In August, Services achieved 73% utilization of key AI tools (CoCounsel V2, OpenArena, MS Copilot 365, and MS Copilot Chat), with CoCounsel V2 reaching 53% adoption among Sourcing and Supplier & Contract Managers, contributing with use cases and opportunities to the Client Zero strategy.","CoCounsel (Next Steps):
•	CoCounsel Core 2.0 Rollout: Phased upgrades through the end of 2025 as they become available.
•	Explore and deploy CoCounsel Drafting ","Q3 Progress & Outlook: The Travel & Expenses AI Agent pilot has been rescheduled from July to September, with development now underway for a Procurement Agent focused on E2E process orchestration. CoCounsel Drafting deployment remains on track for end of Q3-2025, with an updated CoCounsel Prompts Library specifically designed to support contract comparison activities - the most time-intensive task for our Sourcing and Contract Management teams.

RFP Automation Expansion: Following successful UAT completion and June go-live of our RFP Template Generation MVP in Kronos V2, we are now scaling the solution into two specialized use cases: RFP Proposal Responses Summarization (September delivery) and Intelligent RFP Template Generator (Q4 delivery), leveraging our Copilot Studio expertise.

The decision was made to move forward with the pilot without having additional projects being required and test only the functionalities that are available in this model.","During the first discussions of the pilot, we’ve identified that Gong cannot connect the same instance of the tool with difference SFDC instances. Since Latam users are on S2E SFDC instance or SGD as their CRMs, we needed to understand the capabilities / options to be considered under the pilot scope before moving forward. ​

We explored the different options for your Gong implementation, including setting up a new instance, using the existing GSI Salesforce instance, or waiting for another time. ​

We reviewed a comparison matrix of Gong features that would be available under each option, highlighting the limitations of the existing GSI instance in terms of account-based functionality. ​

Building on July’s momentum, the segment introduced an AI-driven account planning assistant (ACES) and formally established a Corporates AI Champions Network to foster grassroots engagement. Corporates held off on fully launching ACES as Europe is not part of the user base yet, targeting a mid-September EU pilot launch with a full launch by beginning of October. 

Gong usage continues to be a challenge and we're putting more emphasis on Gong usage on the next Corporates Conversations to everyone in Corporates.","'1. Limited Copilot License Availability: The shortage of Microsoft Copilot (M365) licenses remains the most pressing issue. Our head of Professional Services and CSMs have requested paid Copilot licenses for all their teams. 
2. Data Silos and Missing Integrations: Several key data sources are not yet connected to our AI tools, impeding their effectiveness. For example, our sales chatbot lacks access to Seismic Advisor (product marketing content) and Gong call data isn’t fully integrated with Copilot/Open Arena queries. Mindtickle and Adobe are additional silos though of lesser importance to GTM vs Advisor.","After June’s rollout of Gong to 600+ Sales, CS, and Account Specialist roles, adoption gained some traction in August with the extention of Gong collaborator licenses to over 850 additional team members (across Professional Services, Solutions Consulting, Product & Industry, and Partnerships teams) so managers and adjacent roles can view call recordings and insights. To further drive usage, the team scheduled extra Gong office hours on Aug 19, 26, and 27 for hands-on support and even launched a Gong/CoPilot SPIFF incentive for sales reps. 

Revenue Intelligence & Forecasting – Path-to-Plan Delivered: The Revenue Intelligence dashboard (Salesforce Einstein analytics) finally went live for Corporates after a delay, with the crucial “Path-to-Plan” feature delivered in early August replacing previously manual Excel effort. ","Communications and Training: We are rolling out a steady drumbeat of AI-focused communications to keep people informed and engaged. The first monthly AI Newsletter will be released in September and we have a regular monthly cadence on the weekly manager's huddle targeting 225 people managers in Corporates. This will be supplemented by an Atrium page serving as a one-stop hub for AI in Corporates (resources, FAQs, contacts), which is slated to go live in late September. 

Cultural Shift Initiatives: Changing mindsets is as important as changing processes. We’re cultivating a culture where experimenting with AI is celebrated. In team meetings, managers now routinely ask for an “AI moment” – e.g., “Has anyone used an AI tool in a new way this week?” – to spark peer sharing","Sustain Adoption and Accelerate Innovation. As we head into the fall, driving adoption of our AI tools across 100% of the team remains the top priority. Our company-wide goal is full AI tool usage by year-end, and we aim to achieve this through encouragement and enablement rather than mandate. In practice, this means continuing the high-touch approach in place: regular manager huddles spotlighting AI wins, more office hours and training (e.g. Gong sessions, Path-to-Plan tutorials), and the launch of monthly AI newsletters and an Atrium site to share tips and success stories segment-wide.

With a year-end goal of 100% active AI usage, we are leveraging dashboards, new hire AI primer paths, and targeted workflow-centric enablement and training by role, tool, and use case to close usage gaps.

Enhanced Training & Enablement: Our training initiatives now include targeted enablement for GTM roles in Gong and mandatory Gong MindTickle modules for new reps and managers, to help them get started w/ Gong. We are also working with GTM leads and central teams to create comprehensive resource hubs relevant to all GTM segments—not just TAAP—for both Gong and enterprise accessible internal AI tools and resources of relevance to the GTM teams.

Gong AI Use Cases: Gong's AI agents are now central to our rep & manager productivity strategy, including:
-Custom AI briefs that synthesize calls, deals, and accounts for structured knowledge transfer
-Prompt frameworks leveraging AI Call Reviewer for enhanced coaching and AI Deal Reviewer for pipeline qualification
-AI alerts and warnings through Deal Monitor for pipeline health and Deal Predictor for closing likelihood
-Gong AI Transcript analyzer for Product teams to extract conversation insights by product (solution currently in Beta - owned by Commercial Excellence)

Other AI Initiatives:
-Aura Copilot discovery (owned by central teams) enabling Seismic users to query sales tools and resources
-ACES Customer Research tool enhancements for pre-call planning across all segments (currently in pilot, owned by Commercial Excellence)

Strategic Expansion: These AI agents eliminate manual work and enhance productivity by integrating seamlessly into GTM workflows, creating an integrated, workflow-centric approach that makes users more effective and efficient in their rep and managerial responsibilities.

Looking ahead, we are prioritizing the latter half of 2025 and early 2026 to focus on non-quota carrying roles and functions, identifying AI opportunities for activities that can be tech-enabled or leverage AI automation.

Key Focus Areas:
-Change management and targeted enablement efforts
-Gong coaching optimization to drive rep performance
-Pipeline management through AI-driven insights and alerts
-Leveraging Gong AI for rep productivity to impact sales metrics and OKRs
-Expanding discovery and AI use case exploration for non-quota carrying roles

This integrated approach positions us to achieve our 100% active usage goal while building scalable AI capabilities across the TAAP organization.","Adoption Gaps: Continued risk of non-compliance with AI usage goals among certain user groups.

AI Tool Integration Limitations: Ex: Gainsight R360 integration is dependent on platform readiness and the C360 integration with Gong was not useful to TAAP.

Resource Hub Fragmentation & Duplication: GTM AI business leads across segments are independently creating resource hubs and curating Gong enablement resources, tools, and videos that could benefit all teams. This creates inefficiency and duplication of efforts. We recommend the central team responsible for Gong ownership create a unified resource hub accessible through Advisor, with capability to link out to segment-specific pages highlighting unique use cases and success stories.

Seismic Aura Copilot Delays: No visible progress updates on the Seismic Aura Copilot bot deployment for Advisor, which would enable sales reps to quickly query and find resources and information through an AI-powered interface. Central teams need to help accelerate this initiative as it benefits all segment GTM teams and is owned by Commercial Excellence.","AI Usage Tracking & Accountability:

"September 2025","Editorial (Product)","9/29/2025","[]","Green - As per plan or better","Our Editorial organization is executing a comprehensive AI transformation strategy, combining immediate operational gains with strategic positioning for future growth. As we move into the agentic space, we are expanding our vision to include AI systems that not only assist but also act autonomously within defined editorial parameters—amplifying our ability to scale, adapt, and lead.

Our AI initiatives in 2025 focus on efficiency gains, simplification, and agentic enablement to support our four core strategic priorities:

Increased Content Currency
Enhanced Value Addition to Content
AI-Ready Content
Coverage Expansion

Primary Focus Areas:

Authored Content Updating
Four funded AI builds are in development for 2025, positioning us for resource optimization advances. These systems are being designed with agentic capabilities in mind—able to proactively identify and update content based on editorial triggers.


Editorial Assistant Automation
Two funded AI builds are in development for 2025. These tools streamline time-intensive, repetitive tasks, enhance consistency and quality, and free specialized resources for high-value activities. As we evolve, these assistants will increasingly operate with more autonomy, initiating actions based on editorial context.


Editorial Expertise
We continue to leverage our unique intellectual capital to position ourselves as leaders in Legal and Tax AI innovation. Our move into agentic systems further differentiates us, enabling AI to act on editorial knowledge rather than just respond to it.


Self-Service AI Solutions
Through “Fast Track” implementation, we empower editorial teams with AI-enhanced capabilities that improve precision and quality. ","Issue: Resources - certain key resources have been tapped to work on additional/alternative projects, and this will impact our projects to some degree.
Risk: Copyright risk persists; but process is in place to track and manage this.
","Our Self-Service AI Solution strategy, which we call the ""Fast Track"" lane has continues to deliver smaller scale, but still impactful AI solutions to drive both efficiencies as well as quality consistency across a variety teams within our Editorial organization.  At the conclusion of Q3 we have now launched almost 50 solutions to ""in use"" status.  This rapid uptick in delivery resulted from an adjustment to our risk assessment process and the increasing familiarity, comfort with, and skill level of editors with AI tools they can use.  The connection between ""theory"" and ""practice"" is being actively wired and this is proof of that.  

Delivery dates of beta releases for our cutting-edge Commentary Content updating approach has been finalized and the final development effort to connect the different systems together are underway. (We now have proven that Commentary Analytical Articles can be drafted in the first instance by Gen AI as opposed to using external authors.  The complexity of the problem the Content Innovation team in our Content Engineering organization has developed a solution for revolutionizes both the approach to creating this content, but as importantly it will allow us to transform this product offering into a much more current and timelier content product for the benefit of our customers.  The build to bring this game changing approach to production is currently underway.)

The Care updating project in the Commentary space has also progressed to connecting plumbing and getting additional end users feedback on system designs.

In our Practical Law space, the Content Updating use case continues to progress towards the end-to-end solution for delivery and is being integrated into the new Content Development UI tool positioning us for an end of year beta release.

The Editorial Assistant use cases which support our Practical Law Editors have progressed as resources were able to rejoin the team, and we are optimistic we will have betas for these features in the next month or two.

The dedicated Codes Reimagine POC completed its first delivery related to the publication of Idaho Bills content using agentic technology.  This is a small step for the program, but a giant leap for establishing the framework and approach the team will use for this entire project.

Finally, we are finalizing our delivery pipeline for 2026, outlining the key initiatives we will pursue and working to solidify our teams, requirements, and priorities so we can start the work.","New Change Management lead for Content & Editorial has joined the Internal AI program.
Continue to leverage established communication and learning approaches (newsletters, dedicated atrium site, team meeting presentations, clinics, town halls, trainings, etc).
","As we near the betas for each of our large releases, we are partnering closely to ensure we have a solid plan for rolling the features out to the various teams, establishing the protocols for feedback, and ensuring we have a clear change management and onboarding plan in place.  We are also positioning the technology teams to be able to address any urgent feedback that needs to be addressed prior to a full roll out.

Will assess financial savings in Q3/Q4 2025.","RISK: Dynamic nature of product management role and activity, based on outcomes rather than outputs, make harder to find one single metric that can be utilized to single out efficiency gains by using AI. While we see the adoption of AI in these roles, it’s harder to estimate impact only based on time-savings dimension.
RISK: Also connected with the above, there are limited specific AI tools for Product Managers, and some may even increase complexity or force strict processes. While we evaluate options to implement a no-code prototyping tool or product management system, our current hypothesis is that generic tools (like Copilot / AI Platform Open Arena) might be best suited for the role – and we may create specific prompts or agents for the specific use cases that we target.


","Five Product Manager use cases are being tracked in Launch stage, three in the Experimentation stage, and five in Ideation stage to be integrated into the product management workflow in support of the Product Operating Model. Product Requirements Document (PRD) Assistant and ADO User Story Builder, ADO Epic & Feature Builder, and Release Notes Generator are Launched, all leveraging both Open Arena and Copilot Chat Agent tools promoted on the Atrium, to the Innovation Team, and Product Manager Copilot license holders for feedback. AI for Product Management Tools Trial is in progress, examining via POC 4 no-code AI prototyping tools for product manager use; recommendation ETA by end of Sept.

Product Design continued to expand AI-assisted use cases with an active focus on the ""Prototyping+"" program trial. September marked a significant milestone with the recommendation to approve v0 by Vercel for a 1 year term as the primary prototyping+ tool for builders for ideation, collaboration, and communication. Builder licenses will be distributed across Product Design (260) and Product Management (40), enabling teams to continue exploration of advanced prototyping use cases such as multi-step user journeys, accessibility review, and collaborative prototyping across UX, content, research, and engineering roles. We are actively sourcing additional use cases, partnering with teams across design to benchmark and reimagine processes and identify opportunities for transformation. Feedback and tool evaluations remain ongoing, with early anecdotal signs of improvements in cross-functional collaboration and faster decision-making. We are seeing great progress in these efforts directly supporting the Product Operating Model by embedding prototyping into early-stage workflows and encouraging scalable experimentation.

In Tax Content Research, we have developed a comprehensive list of AI use cases across all of the teams.  We have prioritized the top cases that will have the largest impact.  We held AWS AI workshops on Direct Tax and Global Trade to determine the biggest areas where AI would have the largest efficiency gains. From this, we are scheduling EBA workshops with AWS to develop POCs on the top 2 areas.  In Direct Tax, we now have a YOY comparison tool.  With AWS, we are building an AI chain that will filter the differences down to those items where changes have to be made in the calculations.  Once developed, we will hook this up a script which we have created that will create the ADO user stories.  We are also hiring two AI Engineers to begin working on those identified use case that need AI agents developed or where Analsyst need assistance on writing code for the AI chains that have been developed.  ","Product Management, Design and Tax Research are focused on engagement for product manager, content analysts, and design-focused solutions via comms, Atrium page and Viva Engage community launch, Innovation Teams, office hours, AI solution and tools focused trainings, expansion of Copilot license activation and promotion, and 3rd party tools trials.  In addition, for Tax & Trade Content Research, we will need to develop reimagined workflows and so additional AI Engineers are needed and being hired. ","Product Management path forward is to enhance existing AI solutions via Open Arena models and Copilot capabilities, while continuing innovation discovery and experimentation toward development of new use cases following the Product Operating Model, and in parallel exploring external AI-prototyping tools via ""future of product management"" tools trials, in collaboration with Design and Product Engineering cross-functional partners.

For Product Design, we plan to scale adoption of AI-assisted prototyping with deeper dives into Figma Make, Figma's AI solution, in addition to integration of v0 by Vercel to accelerate concept testing and customer iteration cycles. The team is shifting a bit from tool experimentation to strategic integration into the TR enterprise with architecture and security reviews underway. The hope is to enable teams to focus on high-impact product market business use cases that highlight measurable time-to-value outcomes. Synthesis of survey feedback from trails will continue to inform tooling decisions and identify opportunities for reimagining new workflows into 2026.

For Tax Research (Content), we are continuing to work on progress with the development of AI chains for the use cases prioritized.  We have identified a gap in skills and so are hiring 2-3 AI Engineers to help push forward the cases which are more complex in development.

With a year-end goal of 100% active AI usage, we are leveraging dashboards, new hire AI primer paths, and targeted workflow-centric enablement and training by role, tool, and use case to close usage gaps.

Enhanced Training & Enablement: Our training initiatives now include targeted enablement for GTM roles in Gong and mandatory Gong MindTickle modules for new reps and managers, to help them get started w/ Gong. We are also working with GTM leads and central teams to create comprehensive resource hubs relevant to all GTM segments—not just TAAP—for both Gong and enterprise accessible internal AI tools and resources of relevance to the GTM teams.

Gong AI Use Cases: Gong's AI agents are now central to our rep & manager productivity strategy, including:
-Custom AI briefs that synthesize calls, deals, and accounts for structured knowledge transfer
-Prompt frameworks leveraging AI Call Reviewer for enhanced coaching and AI Deal Reviewer for pipeline qualification
-AI alerts and warnings through Deal Monitor for pipeline health and Deal Predictor for closing likelihood
-Gong AI Transcript analyzer for Product teams to extract conversation insights by product (solution currently in Beta - owned by Commercial Excellence)
-AI generated meeting prep

Other AI Initiatives:
-Aura Copilot discovery (owned by central teams) enabling Seismic users to query sales tools and resources
-ACES Customer Research tool enhancements for pre-call planning across all segments (currently in pilot, owned by Commercial Excellence)

Strategic Expansion: These AI agents eliminate manual work and enhance productivity by integrating seamlessly into GTM workflows, creating an integrated, workflow-centric approach that makes users more effective and efficient in their rep and managerial responsibilities.

Looking ahead, we are prioritizing the latter half of 2025 and early 2026 to focus on non-quota carrying roles and functions, identifying AI opportunities for activities that can be tech-enabled or leverage AI automation.

Key Focus Areas:
-Change management and targeted enablement efforts
-Gong coaching optimization to drive rep performance
-Pipeline management through AI-driven insights and alerts
-Leveraging Gong AI for rep productivity to impact sales metrics and OKRs
-Expanding discovery and AI use case exploration for non-quota carrying roles

This integrated approach positions us to achieve our 100% active usage goal while building scalable AI capabilities across the TAAP organization.","Adoption Gaps: Continued risk of non-compliance with AI usage goals among certain user groups.

Need visibility and access to non active users (blocked due to RLS) to help drive 100% usage.

Resource Hub Fragmentation & Duplication: GTM AI business leads across segments are independently creating resource hubs and curating Gong enablement resources, tools, and videos that could benefit all teams. This creates inefficiency and duplication of efforts. We recommend the central team responsible for Gong ownership create a unified resource hub accessible through Advisor, with capability to link out to segment-specific pages highlighting unique use cases and success stories.

Seismic Aura Copilot Delays: No visible progress updates on the Seismic Aura Copilot bot deployment for Advisor, which would enable sales reps to quickly query and find resources and information through an AI-powered interface. Central teams need to help accelerate this initiative as it benefits all segment GTM teams and is owned by Commercial Excellence.","AI Usage Tracking & Accountability:

"September 2025","GTM - Corporates","9/24/2025","[]","Green - As per plan or better","As we closed out Q3 2025, the Corporates segment continued to advance its internal AI enablement journey. We maintained focus on driving adoption of our AI tools across all teams, emphasizing Gong, Microsoft 365 Copilot, and other productivity enhancers. In September, we built on prior rollouts by turning to engagement and usage – ensuring that employees integrate AI into daily work to unlock productivity gains and improved customer outcomes. These efforts keep us aligned with TR’s enterprise goal of 100% active AI tool usage by end of 2025, ultimately supporting higher sales productivity and Net Revenue Retention through smarter, AI-driven workflows","The biggest risk to our internal AI program remains uneven adoption. A subset of employees still have not engaged with any of the AI tools, which could jeopardize our 100% adoption target and limit the segment’s overall productivity gains. We are addressing this through targeted outreach and training, but resistance to change and fear of the unknown remain obstacles in a few pockets. We also note that Gong usage is lagging behind expectations – if teams do not consistently record calls or use Gong’s features, we won’t fully realize the benefits of conversational intelligence. This under-utilization has been identified as a critical gap, so leadership is now setting clearer expectations that Gong become part of standard sales routines.

Another issue encountered in September was data quality and trust. When rolling out the Revenue Intelligence dashboards, we faced some data integration issues (e.g. user role mappings and quota data mismatches) that delayed the roll-out and caused initial skepticism. While we resolved the major discrepancies (and instituted a faster data update process to prevent recurrences), this highlighted the importance of reliable data for AI tools – any lingering accuracy issues could undermine user trust in AI insights. 

We’re also mindful of change fatigue. With several new tools introduced this year, employees may feel overwhelmed or confused about where to focus. There’s a risk that without careful coordination, our messages urging use of Gong, Copilot, Revenue Intelligence, etc. could blend into noise. To mitigate this, we are streamlining communications (e.g., a single newsletter, consolidated training site) and pacing our initiatives so as not to overload teams. Finally, on the horizon, licensing and support for Copilot could pose challenges – if demand for M365 Copilot accelerates faster than we can supply licenses or support users, it may cause frustration. We’re working with ETS to manage the trial-to-production transition carefully.","September saw a concerted push on Gong adoption. We launched a Gong resources page on Atrium with on-demand training, tip sheets, and FAQs to help teams maximize Gong’s AI-powered conversation intelligence. Sales and Customer Success teams engaged in role-specific Gong training sessions and began leveraging features like AI-generated call summaries and follow-up email drafts, streamlining their workflows. We also held leadership discussions (e.g. a CLT offsite on Sept 18) to review Gong usage data and share best practices – reinforcing how underutilization of Gong is a missed opportunity that we’re actively addressing. 

Finally, we continued leveraging Gainsight to drive customer success workflows with AI insights. While no new Gainsight features launched in September, usage remains strong and it’s fully integrated into our customer health and retention playbooks. Overall, the month’s focus shifted from introducing new tools to driving active usage of the ones we’ve deployed – setting the stage for tangible productivity wins in Q4","September was a very active month for change management in Corporates, with several new programs and communications launched to drive awareness and adoption of AI tools:

Leadership Engagement: Segment leaders visibly championed AI adoption this month. At the September CLT offsite, our GM and leadership team reviewed AI usage metrics and discussed barriers to adoption, resulting in a clear mandate to their teams to increase usage of tools like Gong and Copilot. This top-down encouragement is proving effective, as managers are now including AI tool utilization in their team check-ins and funnel reviews (making AI a regular part of the conversation).

AI Newsletter Launch: We introduced the inaugural “AI@Work” monthly newsletter in early September, delivered to all ~1,600 team members. This communication showcases recent AI tool developments, quick tips, and success stories, and serves as a friendly guide for those who might not know where to start. The first issue included a welcome message from our segment AI champion (underscoring our vision and the personal value of adopting AI) and links to help resources. Response has been positive – employees have cited the newsletter as a useful one-stop update, and we plan to continue this publication to sustain awareness.

Champion Network: Our network of AI Champions (early adopters and power users across functions) continues to play a crucial role. Champions met twice this month to exchange tips and coordinate outreach. They’ve been pairing up with less active colleagues for 1:1 mentoring (“buddy system” for AI). We see promising results from this grassroots approach – for instance, a few account executives who were hesitant to use Gong are now regularly recording calls after a champion on their team walked them through it and shared the benefits they personally experienced.","Looking ahead to Q4 2025, our priority is to accelerate full adoption and deepen the impact of AI tools in daily operations. We will intensify change management to convert the remaining hesitant users into active AI users, ensuring we hit our segment-wide usage goals. We also intend to broaden our internal use case library and success stories: in the coming weeks, we’ll spotlight how top performers are leveraging AI (e.g. Gong analytics driving deal coaching, Copilot reducing deck prep time) and share these wins across the segment to inspire peers.

In summary, the path forward is about driving usage depth (not just breadth), launching our remaining planned AI tool (ACES), and systematically capturing value. We will continue to refine our approach based on feedback and aim to enter 2026 with a fully AI-empowered workforce and proven results from these tools.","Wang, Billy (Corporates)","Progressed and being actively managed","9/24/2025 8:59 AM","Wang, Billy (Corporates)",

Since some features require CRM connectivity, we decided to proceed with the pilot as is, focusing only on the functionalities available in this setup and avoiding additional projects.

Paola/Mate: Paola/Mate is a tool designed to provide client intelligence before sales calls. It gathers and presents relevant information such as company size, estimated revenue, websites, social media presence, ownership structure, and other strategic data. This allows sales representatives to enter meetings better prepared, with context and knowledge about the client, improving the quality of interactions and the efficiency of negotiations.

Celia: Although CElia was not originally designed for GTM, it can be effectively used as a support tool for territory management. This helps reduce the time spent searching for essential data and supports more efficient territory planning and decision-making.

SIA: SIA is a tool developed to support the Latam sales team, offering artificial intelligence for data analysis, and automation on the decision-making support. The solution integrates information about forecast, pipeline, and commercial performance, making it easier to access strategic insights and optimizing the workflow for sales representatives.

The second phase of the project will focus on delivering data and insights in a self-service format, aiming to provide sales users with a simple and interactive way to engage with their Pipeline, Forecast and Territory.



","Sales Intelligence Driven by Gong: Limited functionalities: Without CRM integration, it won’t be possible to test all features.

Uncertainty about CRM

Paola/Mate: Tool launched, but awareness is still low among the sales team. 

CElia: Since CElia was created a long time ago, we don’t have the flexibility to easily add or remove documents. We need to open a case and wait for it to be processed. As sales territories change and accounts are added during the week, this waiting time becomes a problem.

SIA: We need to reproduce this information at the user level, so each seller or manager should only see their own numbers. We also need to understand how AI will handle this and ensure it only provides information related to the user’s own accounts and deals.
","Sales Intelligence Driven by Gong: We are considering changing our CRM. Since no decision has been made yet, we decided not to purchase new licenses for now to avoid extra costs. In parallel, we adjusted the pilot users by removing those who were not actively using the tool, ensuring visibility of real usage.

Paola/Mate: Tool launched

CElia: CElia is working in Teams and in the Open Arena.

SIA: We are actively collaborating with the technical team to design, develop, and implement the tool, ensuring it meets business requirements and provides a seamless experience for end users.
","N/A","Sales Intelligence Driven by Gong: Change Management for all Latam users

Paola/Mate: Focus will be on internal communication and enablement to ensure sellers understand the value and start using it.

CElia: Focus on internal promotion of the tool within territory teams, encouraging users to direct their questions to the chatbot. CElia will be featured in internal channels to increase visibility and usage.

SIA: The technical team presented us with a solution similar to what is already being used globally. We are now working on understanding how to adapt and replicate this approach for our data and requirements.
